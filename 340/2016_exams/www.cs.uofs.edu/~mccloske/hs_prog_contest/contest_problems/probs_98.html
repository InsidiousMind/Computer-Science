<b>Problem 1: Decimal Representation of Rational Numbers</b></A>

<p>
A rational number is one that can be expressed as a fraction 
<!-- <sup>k</sup>/<sub>m</sub>,  -->
<b>k/m</b>,
where k and m are integers and m is nonzero.
It turns out that these are also the numbers than can be expressed 
in <em>repeating decimal</em> form.
That is, every rational number can also be written in the form
<p>
<center>p.d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> 
... d<sub>n-r</sub> <b>(</b>
d<sub>n-r+1</sub> d<sub>n-r+2</sub> ...  d<sub>n</sub> <b>)</b>
</center>
<br>

<!-- <centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
     <Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
     p.d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> 
     <font face=symbol>¼</font></td>
     <td nowrap align=center>
     <hr NOSHADE>
     d<sub>n-r+1</sub> d<sub>n-r+2</sub> <font face=symbol>¼</font
     >d<sub>n</sub><Br>&nbsp;<br></td><td nowrap align=center>
     </td></Table>
     </td></table></centEr>
-->

where p is an integer, each d<sub>i</sub> is a digit between 0 and 9, and
the
parentheses around <!--  bar over -->
the last r digits indicate that that sequence of digits repeats forever.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input two nonnegative integers
k and m (a numerator and denominator) and that produces as output the
<em>simplest</em> repeating decimal representation of the rational number
<b>k/m</b>.
By simplest we mean that the number of digits appearing after the
decimal point is minimum.
For example, the rational number 13/6 is represented
by each of 
2.1(6), 2.16(6), and 2.1(66),
but only the first of these is in simplest form.
As another example, the simplest repeating decimal representation of 40/4 is
10.(0).

<p>
Your program should terminate when the user enters zero for the
denominator.

<p>
In order to simplify the task of producing output, your results are to be
written in the form p.d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> ... d<sub>n</sub>
&nbsp;&nbsp;r, where r indicates the
length of the repeating sequence of digits.  (See example below.)

<p>
You may assume that any rational number used in testing your program
is such that its simplest repeating decimal representation
has no more than thirty digits appearing after the decimal point.

<b>Problem 2: Any Way Home?</b></A>

<p>
Imagine a country in which each road provides a one-way path from
one city to another.
In such a country there may be cities such that, once you have left
them, there is no way back!

<p>
Write a program that, given as input a table describing the map of
the country, identifies those cities from which it is not possible to 
make a "round trip".
More precisely, the program should identify any city having the property
that there is no path of roads by which you can leave it
and later return to it. 

<p>
The first input is an integer n describing the number of cities
in the country.  (Cities are numbered from 1 to n.)
On the remaining n lines of input is an 
n&times;n table of 0's and 1's describing the map of the country.
A one in row i and column j indicates that there is a one-way road
from city i to city j.  A zero indicates the absence of such
a road.  (Rows are numbered from top to bottom, columns from left to
right, as they appear on the screen.)

<p>
You may assume that n&le;20.
Repeat until the user enters zero for the number of cities.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>
<p>
<tt>
   Enter number of cities: <u>8</u><br>
   <u>0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0</u><br>
   <u>0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1</u><br>

<A NAME="Shortest_Subsequence">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Shortest Substring Containing a Subsequence</b></A>

<p>
Let S and T be strings of letters.
We say that S is a <em>subsequence </em> of T if the letters that
make up S appear in the same order within T, but not necessarily
adjacent to one another. &nbsp;For example, <b>MOO</b> is a subsequence
of <b>NONMONOTONIC</b>, because the letters <b>M</b>, 
<b>O</b>, and <b>O</b> appear within <b>NONMONOTONIC</b>
as the fourth, fifth, and seventh letters, respectively.
&nbsp;However, <b>POT</b> is neither a subsequence of <b>LIFTS</b>
nor of <b>ATROPHY</b>.  In the first case, not all of the letters in
<b>POT</b> appear in <b>LIFTS</b>; in the second case,
although all the letters of <b>POT</b> are present in
<b>ATROPHY</b>, they are not in the proper order.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input two strings S and T
of lower case letters and reports whether or not S is a subsequence of T.
If it is not, your program should simply print 0; if it is, your program
should print the starting and ending positions of the
<em>shortest </em> substring of T containing S as a subsequence.
(Positions are numbered from left to right starting at 1.)
If there are two or more shortest substrings of T containing S as a
subsequence, identify the leftmost such substring.

<p>
Your program should repeat until two empty strings are issued as input.
You may assume that no string has length exceeding 80.

<p>

<p>
  Enter S: <u>ben</u><br>
  Enter T: <u>aboekneno</u><br>

<A NAME="String_Editor">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: String Editor</b></A>

<p>
You are to write a program that accepts as input a single string and then
allows the user to enter commands that modify the string.
Your program should implement five types of commands: DELETE, REPLACE,
INSERT, RESTART, and QUIT.

<p>
If the user enters the command DELETE, your program should prompt the user
for the starting and ending positions of the substring to be deleted.
(Positions are numbered from left to right starting at 1.)

<p>
If the user enters the command REPLACE, your program should prompt the
user for the starting and ending positions of the substring to be replaced,
and then prompt the user for the replacement string.  (Note that the
replacement string need not be the same length as the one being replaced.)

<p>
If the user enters the command INSERT, your program should prompt
the user for the position at which to insert a string, and then prompt
for the string to be inserted.

<p>
For each of the above commands, after the user has responded to the 
prompt, your program should carry out the command, 
print the updated string,
and then prompt the user to enter another command. 

<p>
If the user enters the command RESTART, your program should discard
the current string and prompt the user to enter a new string.

<p>
If the user enters the command QUIT, your program should terminate.

<p>
You may assume that the length of the string being edited will never
exceed 80 characters.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>
<tt>
<p>
  Enter string: <u>Existence precedes essence.</u>
  <br><br>
<p>
  Command: <u>DELETE</u><br>
  Starting position: <u>11</u><br>
  Ending position: <u>19</u><br><br>
  Existence essence.
  <br><br>
<p>
  Command: <u>INSERT</u><br>
  Starting position: <u>6</u> <br>
  Insertion string: <u>EE</u> <br><br>
  ExistEEence essence.
  <br><br>
<p>
  Command: <u>RESTART</u><br><br>
  Enter string: <u>Nowhere</u><br>
  Command: <u>REPLACE</u><br>

<A NAME="Scheduling">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Scheduling</b></A>

<p>
You are to write a program that schedules jobs as follows. &nbsp;The program
should first prompt for the number of jobs to be scheduled, an integer
between 0 and 10. &nbsp;Next the program should prompt for the arrival time and
duration of each job, where the arrival time will be an integer between 0
and 19 and the duration will be an integer between 1 and 10. &nbsp;Your program
should output a schedule indicating what job should be worked on at each
point in time between time 0 and the time when all jobs have finished.

<p>
A job cannot be worked on until it arrives, and jobs are prioritized so that
shorter jobs will be worked on first. &nbsp;If a job arrives that will take less
time to complete than the job currently being worked on, the current job is
interrupted <!-- and "put on pause" -->
while the shorter job is worked on.
Now, it may happen that this shorter job is interrupted by an even shorter
job.  And so on and so forth.
When a job is completed, if others are waiting to be resumed or
started, the job needing the shortest amount of time to complete should be
worked on next.  (Ties are broken by arrival time: the earlier the arrival
time, the higher the priority.)

<p>
Your output should indicate, as illustrated in the example below,
the times at which the jobs are started, interrupted, resumed, and
completed.
Until the user enters 0 for the number of jobs, your program should repeat.

<p>
The complexity of the example shown below merits explanation:
Job 1 arrives at time 3, and since it is the only job available,
it is started.  When job 2 (with duration 7) arrives at time 4, it 
takes priority over job 1, because job 1 has 9 remaining units of time.
Thus, job 1 is interrupted and job 2 is started.  Job 3 arrives at time
7, but since its duration, 5 units, exceeds the time remaining for job 2, 
4 units, we do not interrupt job 2.  However, job 4's arrival at time 9
causes us to interrupt job 2 (which has 2 remaining units of time, compared
to job 4's having duration 1).  Job 4 finishes at time 10, at which time
we resume job 2, because, among all jobs present (jobs 1, 2, and 3), it
has the smallest remaining time to completion.
By the time job 2 finishes, job 5 has arrived.  Among jobs still
present (jobs 1, 3, and 5), job 5 has the smallest remaining time to
completion, and thus it is started.  When job 5 completes, job 3 is started,
because it takes priority over job 1.  Finally, job 3 finishes, job 1 is
resumed, and it finishes.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>

<p>
  Enter number of jobs: <u>5</u><br>
  Enter arrival time for job 1: <u>2</u><br>
  Enter duration for job 1: <u>11</u><br>

<A NAME="Rectangles_and_Points">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Rectangles and Points</b></A>

<p>
You are to write a program that
prompts the user to enter two ordered pairs of real numbers,
(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>), each of which represents a point on the
cartesian plane.  These points are to be interpreted to be opposing
corners of a rectangle whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
(That is, two sides of the rectangle are horizontal and the other two
are vertical).

<p>
Your program is then to (repeatedly) prompt the user for an ordered
pair of real numbers (x,y) representing another point on the plane.
For each such point entered by the user, the program should output the
distance from that point to the point on the perimeter of the rectangle
which is closest to it.

<p>
The third point may be anywhere in the plane, including inside
the rectangle, outside the rectangle, or on its perimeter.

<p>
The program should terminate when the point entered corresponds
to the first corner of the rectangle.

<p>
<em>Reminder: </em> The distance between points
(u<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>1</sub>) and (u<sub>2</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>) is
the square root of
<!-- [<font face=symbol>Ö</font> -->
(u<sub>1</sub> - u<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> + 
 (v<sub>1</sub> - v<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup>.
