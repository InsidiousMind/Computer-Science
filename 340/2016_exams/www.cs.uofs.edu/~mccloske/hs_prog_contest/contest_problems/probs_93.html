<b>Problem 1: Wrap Around Numbers</b></A>

<p>
Let's define a trip through a number to be constructed as follows:
Visit the leftmost digit of the number.  That digit tells you which
digit to visit next: move to the right, wrapping around to the left
end of the number if necessary, as many places as the value of the
digit.  Continue this process until some digit is visited for a second
time.  If all digits have been visited, the number qualifies as a
<b>wrap around number</b>.  Otherwise, it does not.

<p>
For example, consider the number 32741.  We visit the leftmost digit,
which tells us to next visit the digit <b>three</b> places to the right,
which is the 4.  Next we visit the 7 (which is <b>four</b> places to
the right of the 4), then the 1, then the 3 again.  The trip has
returned to a digit for the second time without having visited all
the digits.  (The 2 was never visited.)  Thus, 32741 is <em>not</em>
a wrap around number.  On the other hand, 3233 <em>is</em> a wrap around
number, as we would first visit the leftmost 3, then the rightmost 3,
then the middle 3, then the 2, and then return to the rightmost 3.
All four digits are visited.

<p>
Write a program that accepts as input a positive integer having at most
twelve digits and that reports whether or not it is a wrap around number.
The program should repeat until the user enters zero as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter input: <u>872</u><br />
872 IS a wrap around number.<br />
<br />
Enter input: <u>351267853</u><br />
351267853 IS NOT a wrap around number.<br />
<br />

Enter input: <u>0</u>

<b>Problem 2: Oh only have Oh's for a</b></A>

<p>
The term <em>plaintext</em> refers to a message in "ordinary" form.
The term <em>ciphertext</em> refers to an encoded form of some plaintext.
The process of translating plaintext to ciphertext is called
<em>encoding</em> and the inverse process is called <em>decoding</em>.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a string of characters
(serving as plaintext), outputs its ciphertext, according to the following
encoding scheme:
<ul>
  <li>Each vowel in plaintext is translated into the vowel following it
      in the sequence <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>O</b>,
      <b>U</b>, <b>A</b>.
  </li>
  <li>Any character that is not a vowel is translated into itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may assume that the plaintext given as input contains no lower case
letters and has length no greater than 40.  The program should repeat
until the user enters plaintext of length zero.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter plaintext: <u>YOUR CAT IS AN IDIOT.</u><br />
Ciphertext: <u>YUAR CET OS EN ODOUT.</u><br />
<br />
Enter plaintext: <u></u><br />

<b>Problem 3: Back in the Saddle Again</b></A>

<p>
Let <b>A</b> be an <em>m</em>&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;<em>n</em> integer array.
(This means that <b>A</b> is a (two-dimensional) table having
<em>m</em> rows and <em>n</em> columns each element of which is an integer.)

A <em>saddle point</em> of <b>A</b> is an element that is 
<ul>
  <li>larger than any other in its row and smaller than
      any other in its column (called a <b>type 1</b> saddle point), or
  </li>
  <li>smaller than any other in its row and larger than any
      other in its column (called a <b>type 2</b> saddle point). 
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
It is not difficult to prove that, in any two-dimensional integer
array, there can be at most one saddle point of each of the two types.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a two-dimensional integer array,
reports (in the format shown below) which of its elements are saddle points.
The program should repeat until the user indicates that the array to be
processed has zero rows.  No array given as input will exceed 20 rows or
20 columns.

<A NAME="Tens_Complements">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Ten's Complements</b></A>

<p>
The <em>ten's complement</em> of a nonnegative integer <em>n</em> is 
the integer formed by subtracting each digit of <em>n</em> from 9
and then adding one to the result.  For example, the ten's complement
of 35 is 64&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, or 65.

<p>
Note that the ten's complement of 27 is 73 but that the ten's complement
of 0027 is 9973.  Thus, the ten's complement of a number depends upon
how many leading zeros we include in expressing it.
(For this reason it is more accurate to say that each representation
of a number has a ten's complement than to say that each number has a
ten's complement.)

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a nonnegative integer having
no more than 20 digits, outputs its ten's complement.
The program should repeat until the user enters 000 as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter number: <u>83078</u><br />
Ten's complement: 16922<br />
<br />
Enter number: <u>0083078</u><br />

<br />
Enter number: <u>300</u><br />

<A NAME="Cash_Register">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Cash Register</b></A>

<p>
Write a program that "makes change" from a cash register for a
series of purchases.  In order to keep the problem relatively
simple, you are to assume that the cash register has an unlimited
supply of one dollar bills.  (In particular, this means that the
amount of change, in coins, returned to a customer should never
exceed 99 cents.)

<p>
The program should begin by reading a set of inputs that indicates
how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies can be found,
initially, in the cash register.
That will be followed by a series of cash register transactions,
each of which occurs as a result of a customer purchase.
Each transaction consists of two steps:
first, the customer pays (i.e., tenders cash) for the purchase, and,
second, the customer is given correct change.

The first step of each transaction is described by six inputs:
<ol>
  <li>purchase price, in dollars
      (real number with at most two digits after decimal point),</li>
  <li>amount tendered, in dollars
      (real number with at most two digits after decimal point),</li>
  <li>number of quarters tendered (nonnegative integer)</li>
  <li>number of dimes tendered (nonnegative integer)</li>
  <li>number of nickels tendered (nonnegative integer)</li>
  <li>number of pennies tendered (nonnegative integer)</li>
</ol>
The number of quarters, dimes, etc., tendered by the customer is
important, because your program must keep track of how many of each
kind of coin are available in the cash register for making change.

<p>
The second step of each transaction is reported, as output, by your
program.  Specifically, the program should display the total amount of 
change to be returned to the customer, followed by the number of 
quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies used in making that change. 
The number of coins used in making change should be the minimum possible.
This depends not only upon the amount of change, but also upon how many
of each kind of coin are currently available in the cash register.
For example, if 56 cents are to be returned, the preferred solution is
to use two quarters, one nickel, and one penny (a total of four coins).
However, if the register has only one quarter, then that quarter, 
plus 31 cents in available dimes, nickels, and pennies would be used to 
make change.  (This would require at least five coins.)
If it is not possible to make exact change with the coins available in 
the cash register, the transaction is voided (meaning that the coins
tendered by the customer are given back) and a relevant message is 
displayed.  (See example below.)

<p>
You may assume that the inputs describing a transaction are "valid".  
For example, the amount tendered cannot be less than the purchase
price.  Also, the number of quarters, etc., tendered must be consistent
with the amount tendered.  For example, if the amount tendered is 13.72,
then the values of the coins tendered must add up to some number of dollars 
(no more than 13) and 72 cents.

<p>
A number of observations about the sample program execution below may
be helpful.  Notice that, in the first transaction, the customer tendered
over a dollar in coins.  This is acceptable.  Notice that the second
transaction was voided because the cash register had too few pennies to
make four cents change.  (There were initially five pennies in the
register, but two were removed in making change for the first purchase,
leaving only three.)
Notice that, in the third transaction, one dime and two nickels were used
in making change, rather than two dimes.  This is due to the fact that
there was only one dime remaining in the register after the second 
transaction.

<b>Problem 6: Right Triangles</b></A>

<p>
Write a program that, given as input three distinct points on the 
cartesian plane
---(<em>x<sub>1</sub></em>,&nbsp;<em>y<sub>1</sub></em>),
(<em>x<sub>2</sub></em>,&nbsp;<em>y<sub>2</sub></em>), and
(<em>x<sub>3</sub></em>,&nbsp;<em>y<sub>3</sub></em>)---
reports whether the triangle they form is a right triangle.

<p>
The program should repeat until the user's input is such that the
three points are not all distinct.

<p>
Recall that a triangle is a right triangle if and only if the square
of the length of its longest side is equal to the sum of the squares
of the lengths of its other two sides.
