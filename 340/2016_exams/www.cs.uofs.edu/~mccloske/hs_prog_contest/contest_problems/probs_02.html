<b>Problem 1: Fibonacci Sequences</b>


<p>
A fibonacci sequence is an (infinite) sequence of numbers such that,
beginning with the third element, each is the sum of the previous two.
Hence, all the elements in a fibonacci sequence are determined by the
first two.  The fibonacci sequence most often cited is the one whose
first two elements are both one.  Its initial segment of length eleven
(i.e., the sequence comprised of its first eleven elements) is as follows:
<br />
<p>

<center>1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89<br /></center>

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input two integers i and j and a
positive integer k, generates as output the initial segment of length k
of the fibonacci sequence whose first two elements are i and j,
respectively.

<p>
<b>Input</b> <br />
The first line will contain a positive integer m indicating how many
instances of the problem are to be solved.  On each of the subsequent
m lines, a single instance will be described by means of three numbers:
i, j, and k as described above.

<p>
<b>Output</b> <br />
For each instance of the problem given as input (as described by i,
j, and k), print the first k elements of the fibonacci sequence
whose first two elements are i and j, respectively.

<p>
<b>Sample input</b>

<b>Corresponding output</b>

<p>
<b>Problem 2: Durations in Normal Form</b>


<p>
An expression of the form <br />

<center>W Days, X Hours, Y Minutes, Z Seconds <br /></center>

<p>
(where W, X, Y, and Z are nonnegative integers) describes a duration.
Such an expression is said to be in <em>normal form</em>
if W  &gt;  0, 0  &lt;  X  &lt;  24, 0  &lt;  Y  &lt;  60, and 0  &lt;  Z  &lt;  60.
For example, each of the following is in normal form: <br />

<center>
<p>
  5 Days, 16 Hours, 12 Minutes, 53 Seconds<br />
  13 Days, 45 Minutes, 16 Seconds<br />
  21 Hours, 8 Minutes<br />
  36 Minutes<br />
</center>

<p>
Notice how we omit mention of any unit of measure that is not needed
(because the corresponding number of units is zero).  In the third expression
above, for instance, we mention neither Days nor Seconds.

<p>
In contrast to the above, none of the following expressions is in normal form,
the first because the number of Hours exceeds 23, the second because the
number of seconds exceeds 59, and the third because Hours are mentioned
when it need not be. <br />

<center>
<p>
  5 Days, 49 Hours, 33 Minutes <br />
  2 Days, 7 Hours, 5 Minutes, 93 Seconds <br />
  1 Days, 0 Hours, 51 Minutes, 4 Seconds <br />
</center>

<p>
You are to develop a program that, given as input a duration (in the form
of a sequence of four nonnegative integers representing numbers of days,
hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively), produces as output the same
duration but expressed in normal form.

<p>
<b>Input</b> <br />
The first line will contain a positive integer m indicating how many
durations are to be processed.  Each of the next m lines will contain
a description of a duration in the form of four nonnegative integers
(separated by one or more spaces) representing numbers of 
days, hours, minutes, and seconds, respectively.

<p>
<b>Output</b> <br />
For each duration given as input, the program should produce three lines
of output.  The first line echoes the duration given as input.  The second
line expresses the same duration, but in normal form.  The third line is
blank.

<p>
<b>Sample input</b>

<pre>4
5 49 33 0
2 7 5 3573
1 0 67 120
5 2 43 15 
</pre>

<p>
<b>Corresponding output</b>

<pre>Duration 1:  5 Days, 49 Hours, 33 Minutes, 0 Seconds
Normal Form: 7 Days, 1 Hours, 33 Minutes

Duration 2:  2 Days, 7 Hours, 5 Minutes, 3573 Seconds
Normal Form: 2 Days, 8 Hours, 4 Minutes, 33 Seconds

Duration 3:  1 Days, 0 Hours, 67 Minutes, 120 Seconds
Normal Form: 1 Days, 1 Hours, 9 Minutes

Duration 4:  5 Days, 2 Hours, 43 Minutes, 15 Seconds
Normal Form: 5 Days, 2 Hours, 43 Minutes, 15 Seconds

<b>Problem 3: Smallest Two-Distinct-Digits Multiple</b>


<p>
For every positive integer n, there exists a positive multiple of n
whose decimal representation contains exactly two distinct digits.
Develop a program that, given as input a positive integer n, outputs the
smallest such multiple of n.

<p>
<b>Input</b> <br />
The first line will contain a positive integer m indicating how many
numbers are to be processed.  Each of the next m lines will contain a 
positive integer.

<p>
<b>Output</b> <br />
For each number given as input, three lines of output should be
generated.  The first echoes the number, the second indicates the smallest
positive multiple of that number containing exactly two distinct digits,
and the third is blank.

<b>Problem 4: Occurrence-Counting Fixed Points</b>


<p>
Let us define the <em>occurrence-counting operation</em> as follows:
when applied to a sequence S of integers, this operation yields the
sequence T obtained by replacing each value in S by the number of
occurrences of that value in S.

<p>
For example, suppose we have the sequence

<!-- <p> -->

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
S<sub>0</sub> = &lt; 2, 1, 2, -3, 5, 1, 5, 2, 9, 12 &gt;</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>


Applying the occurrence-counting operation to it, we get the sequence

<!-- <p> -->

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
S<sub>1</sub> = &lt; 3, 2, 3, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1 &gt;</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<p>
Notice that wherever S<sub>0</sub> contains 2, S<sub>1</sub> contains 3,
due to the fact that 2 occurs three times in S<sub>0</sub>.
Similarly, wherever S<sub>0</sub> contains 1, S<sub>1</sub> contains 2,
because 1 occurs twice in S<sub>0</sub>.

<p>
Applying the operation to S<sub>1</sub> yields

<!-- <p> -->

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
S<sub>2</sub> = &lt; 3, 4, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3 &gt;
</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>

<p>
Applying the operation to S<sub>2</sub> yields

<!-- <p> -->

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
S<sub>3</sub> = &lt; 6, 4, 6, 6, 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, 6 &gt;
</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<p>
If we apply the operation to S<sub>3</sub>, the resulting sequence is S<sub>3</sub> 
once again (because, in S<sub>3</sub>, 6 occurs six times and 4 occurs four times!).
A sequence such as this (i.e., one that yields itself when the
occurrence-counting operation is applied to it) is said to be a
fixed point (of that operation).

<p>
It is a fact that, if, as illustrated above, we repeatedly apply the
occurrence-counting operation (starting with some sequence S), we will
eventually obtain a sequence that is a fixed point.

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a sequence S of integers and
produces as output the fixed point obtained by repeatedly applying
the occurrence-counting operation, starting with S.
The output should also report the number of applications of the
operation needed to arrive at that fixed point (for the first time).

<p>
<b>Input</b> <br />
The first line will be a positive integer m indicating the number of
instances of the problem that are to be solved.  The following 2m lines
contain the m instances, with each instance described on two lines.
The first line of each instance gives the length n (0  &lt;  n  <font face="symbol">£</font
> 40)
of the sequence to be analyzed. The second line contains the sequence.

<p>
<b>Output</b> <br />
For each instance, four lines of output should be generated.
The first echoes the input sequence.
The second gives the fixed point obtained from that sequence via
repeated application of the occurrence-counting operation.
The third reports how many applications of the operation were necessary
in order to arrive at that fixed point.
The fourth line is blank.

<b>Problem 5: Area Covered by Overlapping Rectangles</b>


<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a set of rectangles lying on the
cartesian plane, reports the total area covered by those rectangles.
(This is not as simple as finding the sum of the areas of the given
rectangles, because the area of any section of the plane covered by
two or more rectangles should be counted only once.)

<p>
In order to make the problem less difficult, you may make three
assumptions about the rectangles given as input:

<ol type="1"><p>
<li>       They all lie entirely on the finite sub-plane bounded by the
      lines x = 0, x = 100, y = 0, and y = 100.</li>
<p>
<li>       All their sides are either parallel or perpendicular to the line
      x = 0.</li>
<p>
<li>       All their corners correspond to points whose x- and y-coordinates
      are integers.</li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Input:</b> <br />
The first line will contain a positive integer m indicating how many
instances of the problem are to be solved.  Subsequent lines encode
the instances.  The first line of each instance contains a positive
integer n indicating the number of rectangles to be processed.
Each of the next n lines contains a description of one of those
rectangles.  Such a description contains four integers (all
between 0 and 100, inclusive) x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, and 
y<sub>2</sub>, with x<sub>1</sub>  &lt;  x<sub>2</sub> and y<sub>1</sub>  &gt;  y<sub>2</sub>.
That is, (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) is the point corresponding to the
<em>upper left</em> corner of the rectangle and (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>)
is the <em>lower right</em> corner.

<p>
<b>Output:</b> <br />
For each instance, report the area covered.

<p>

<b>Problem 6 Bridge Hand Evaluation</b>


<p>
In a standard deck of playing cards, there are 52 cards, each one
uniquely identified by its suit (either Spades, Diamonds, Hearts,
or Clubs) and its rank (any of 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, Jack, Queen, King,
or Ace).

<p>
In many card games, each player is dealt a hand (a collection
of cards from the deck) and plays it via a sequence of tricks,
each one either a winning or losing trick.

<p>
In the card game Bridge, each player evaluates her hand of thirteen
cards prior to bidding against the other.  The most popular method of
hand evaluation is called the Milton-Work evaluation method.  In this
method, each Ace found in the player's hand is worth four points,
each King is worth three points, each Queen is worth two points, and
each Jack is worth one point.

<p>
Another method is known as the Losing Trick Count method, which works
by estimating the number of losing tricks, or losers, that the player
will suffer in playing her hand.  For each of the four suits, we count
the number of losers for that suit.  If a hand contains no cards from
a suit, count no losers for that suit.  If a hand contains exactly one 
card from a suit, count one loser if it is not the Ace and zero losers
otherwise.  If a hand contains exactly two cards from a suit, the
number of losers for that suit corresponds to how many of the two ranks
Ace and King are not among the ranks of those two cards.  If a hand
contains three or more cards from a suit, the number of losers for that
suit corresponds to how many of the three ranks Ace, King, and Queen are
not among the ranks of those (three or more) cards.

<p>
<b>Input:</b><br />
The first line of input will be a positive integer m indicating the
number of Bridge hands to evaluate.  Each of the subsequent m lines
will contain a description of a Bridge hand.  In describing a Bridge
hand, one character will be used for representing each card.
Specifically, Ace is denoted by `A', King by `K', Queen by `Q',
Jack by `J', and Ten by `T'.  Smaller ranks are denoted by the
corresponding digits.  That is, Nine is denoted by `9', Eight by `8', etc.
Each hand will be sorted into four suits; within each suit, the cards
will be sorted by rank from the Ace downward to the two.  A space will
separate the cards in one suit from those in the next.  If a suit does
not contain any cards, the suit will be represented by a dash (-).

<p>
<b>Output:</b><br />
The program will output the hand, followed by the Milton-Work point
count and the Losing Trick Count losers.

<p>
<b>Sample input</b>

<pre>2
AK A54 T9432 KJ5
KQ5432 J76 - K854

</pre>

<p>
<b>Corresponding output</b>

<pre>Hand 1: AK A54 T9432 KJ5
Milton-Work Points: 15
Losing Tricks: 7

Hand 2: KQ5432 J76 - K854
Milton-Work Points: 9
Losing Tricks: 6
