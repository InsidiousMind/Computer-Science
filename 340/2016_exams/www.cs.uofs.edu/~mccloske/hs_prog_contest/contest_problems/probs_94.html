<b>Problem 1: Perfect Numbers</b></A>

<p>
A positive integer is said to be a perfect number if it is equal to the 
sum of its positive divisors less than itself.  For example, 28 is 
perfect, because 
<center>
  28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
</center>

<p>
On the other hand, 12 is not perfect, because 
<center>
  12 &ne; 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6
</center>

<p>
You are to write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive
integer and responds by reporting whether or not the given number is
perfect.  The program should terminate when the user enters 0.


<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter a positive integer: <u>12</u><br />
12 IS NOT perfect.<br />
<br />
Enter a positive integer: <u>28</u><br />
28 IS perfect.<br />
<br />
Enter a positive integer: <u>0</u>
</tt>

<b>Problem 2: Add Them Up</b></A>

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input two "long" nonnegative integers 
and ouputs their sum.  The inputs will be no longer than 30 digits.
(Thus, their sum will be no longer than 31 digits.)
The program should repeat until the user enters zero for both inputs.
<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
1st input:  <u>10371</u><br />
2nd input:  <u>315</u><br />
Result: 10686<br />
<br /> 
1st input: <u>54696543201678654789456</u><br />
2nd input: <u>82067690004564356875434</u><br />
Result: 136764233206243011664890<br />
<br />
1st input: <u>0</u><br />
2nd input: <u>0</u><br />

<b>Problem 3: English Mathematical Parser</b></A>

<p>
<P>Develop a program that reads an arithmetic expression written in English,
such as
<p>
<center>
  NINE&nbsp; PLUS&nbsp; SEVEN
</center>
<p>
and that outputs the number that is the result of evaluating the expression.

<p>
More precisely, the input will be a one-digit number, written as a word in
upper case letters, followed by a space, followed by one of the words
"PLUS", "MINUS", "TIMES", or "DIVIDED-BY", followed by a space, followed
by another one-digit number, written as a word in upper case letters.

<p>Here, "DIVIDED-BY" means integer division.
(Example: 8 divided by 3 is 2.)&nbsp;
The spellings for one-digit numbers are as follows: "ZERO", "ONE", "TWO",
"THREE", "FOUR", "FIVE", "SIX", "SEVEN", "EIGHT", and "NINE".

You may assume that no input expression will call for division by zero.
Your program should repeat until the user enters an expression that evaluates
to zero.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Input: <u>NINE PLUS FOUR</u><br />
Result: 13<br />
<br />
Input: <u>FIVE MINUS SEVEN</u><br />
Result: -2<br />
<br />
Input: <u>EIGHT DIVIDED-BY THREE</u><br />
Result: 2<br />
<br />
Input: <u>ZERO TIMES SIX</u><br />
Result: 0<br />

<A NAME="Conjugates">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Conjugates</b></A>

<p>
Two strings <b>X</b> and <b>Y</b> are said to be conjugates if, 
by shifting the symbols of <b>Y</b> in a cyclic fashion zero or 
more times, you can arrive at <b>X</b>.
For example, the strings <em>ababba</em> and <em>abbaab</em> 
are conjugates because by shifting the symbols of the latter
two positions to the right (or, equivalently, four positions to the left),
you arrive at the former.
On the other hand, <em>ababba</em> and <em>abaabb</em> are not conjugates,
as you can easily verify.
It is clear from the definition that two strings cannot be conjugates
unless they have the same length.

<P>
You are to develop a program that prompts the user to enter two strings 
(the maximum length for a string is 20 characters) and that responds by
reporting whether the two are conjugates.  The program terminates when
the user enters the empty string.  </P>

<P>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter 1st string: <u>ababba</u><br />
Enter 2nd string: <u>abbaab</u><br />
The two strings are conjugates.<br />
<br />
Enter 1st string: <u>ababba</u><br />
Enter 2nd string: <u>abaabb</u><br />
The two strings are NOT conjugates.<br />
<br />
Enter 1st string: <u>ababbbbacabba</u><br />
Enter 2nd string: <u>acbabaabb</u><br />
The two strings are NOT conjugates.<br />
<br />
Enter 1st string: <u></u><br />

<A NAME="Wraparound_Numbers">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Wraparound Numbers</b></A>

<p>
Let us consider each digit in a positive integer to be:
<ol>
  <li>a "place" we can visit, and</li>
  <li>an instruction telling us how many places to the right we should
      move (wrapping around to the leftmost digit when necessary) to 
      find the next place to visit.</li>
</ol>

<P>
For example, take the number 2635.  Let us begin by visiting its leftmost
digit, 2.  It tells us that we should next visit the digit <b>two</b>
places to its right, which is the 3.  The 3 tells us to move <b>three</b>
places to the right, which (wrapping around) lands us on the 6.
We then move <b>six</b> places to the right (again wrapping around) 
to land on the 5.  Moving <b>five</b> places to the right (which involves
wrapping around twice) lands us on the 2.
Notice that we are back to where we started and that every digit has been
visited.  This property characterizes the so-called 
<em>wraparound numbers</em>. 
That is, a wraparound number is a positive integer having the property
that, if we begin by visiting its leftmost digit and proceed to visit its
digits according to the rule we followed in the example above,
<!-- we will end up back at the leftmost digit -->
all digits will be visited, and, furthermore, the first digit to be 
visited for a second time will be the leftmost one.
Thus, 2635 is a wraparound number.</P>

<P>
For another example, take 21674.  It is <em>not</em> a wraparound number,
because if we begin by visiting the 2, we will next visit the 6, then the
7, then the 2, then the 6, then the 7, etc., etc., never having visited
the 1 or the 4.
As a last example, take 12.  It is <em>not</em> a wraparound number, because
we would visit the 1, then the 2, and then the 2 again, failing to return to
the leftmost digit.

<P>
You are to write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer
and that responds by telling whether or not it is a wraparound number.
The program should terminate when the user enters the number 0.</P>


<P>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br />

<p>
<tt>
Please enter a number: <u>2635</u><br />
2635 IS a wraparound number.<br />
<br />
Please enter a number: <u>21674</u><br />
21674 IS NOT a wraparound number.<br />
<br />
Please enter a number: <u>0</u>

<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Square Roots</b></A>

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a positive integer
<!-- real number -->
and outputs an approximation to its square root.
Your program may not include a call to any built-in root-finding
subprogram that may be available in your programming language environment.

<p>
The value computed by your program is considered to be correct if it
satisfies at least one of the following conditions:
<ul>
  <li>It differs from the actual square root of the input by 
      no more than 0.001.</li>
  <li>Its square differs from the input by no more than 0.001.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The program should terminate when the user enters zero as input.</P>

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter an integer: <u>9</u><br />
Square root is 3.0008<br />
<br />
Enter an integer: <u>27</u><br />
Square root is 5.196<br />
<br />
Enter an integer: <u>0</u>
</tt>

<!-- 
  Enter a real number: <u>9.0</u><br />
  Square root is 3.0008<br />
  <br />
  Enter a real number: <u>27.0</u><br />
  Square root is 5.1961<br />
  <br />
  Enter a real number: 0.0<br />
