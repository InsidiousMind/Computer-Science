<b>Problem 1: Holey Squares</b></A>

<p>
A <em>holey square</em> is a square matrix each element of which is
either a decimal digit or a "hole" (i.e., unoccupied).
The digit in the first column of the first row (upper lefthand corner)
is called the <em>starting digit</em>.
As you scan the rows from top to bottom, each row from left to right,
you find that the digits occur in succession (0 is followed by 1, 
which is followed by 2, ..., which is followed by 9, which is
followed by 0).
You also find that a hole appears immediately after each 
occurrence of a particular digit, called the <em>holey digit</em>.
To illustrate, here is the holey square of size 5 
(i.e., having 5 rows and 5 columns)
having 7 as its starting digit and 9 as its holey digit:

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1">
<tr> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>9</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>0</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>6</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>9</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> </tr>
<tr> <td>5</td> <td>6</td> <td>7</td> <td>8</td> <td>9</td> </tr>
</table>

-->

<p>
Develop a program that accepts as input the size, starting digit,
and holey digit of a holey square, and that produces as output 
the corresponding holey square.
The program should terminate when the user enters zero as the size.

<A NAME="Binary_to_Decimal">

<b>Problem 2: Binary to Decimal Translation</b></A>

<p>
In an electronic computer, all data is represented in <em>binary</em> form,
i.e., as a sequence of 0's and 1's.  In particular, integers are usually
represented using the <em>binary number system</em>, as opposed to the 
<em>decimal number system</em> to which you are accustomed.
These two number systems are actually very much alike.
Indeed, they are both <em>positional</em> number systems, which means 
that the "contribution" made by each digit in a number depends not only
upon its value but also upon its position within the number.

<p>
In the decimal (or base ten) system, we use the ten digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9.
Going from right to left, the positions in a number correspond to 
units of 1, 10, 100, 1000, etc.
(Notice that these are the powers of 10: 10<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 
10<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, 10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;100,
10<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1000, etc.)&nbsp;
The expression 45038 is to be understood to mean<br /><br />
<center>
8&#215;1 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 3&#215;10 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0&#215;100 
&nbsp;+&nbsp; 5&#215;1000 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 4&#215;10000
</center>

<p>
The binary (or base two) number system is just the same, except that 
we use only the two digits 0 and 1, and the positions in a number 
correspond to units of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. (the powers of 2).
Thus, for example, 1001101<sub>2</sub> (the subscript indicates that the
number is to be interpreted as one written in binary notation) is to be
understood to mean<br />
<center>
1&#215;1 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0&#215;2 &nbsp;+&nbsp 1&#215;4 
&nbsp;+&nbsp; 1&#215;8 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0&#215;16 &nbsp;+&nbsp;
0&#215;32 &nbsp;+&nbsp; 1&#215;64
</center>

<p>
which, in decimal notation, is 77.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a number expressed in the
binary number system, outputs the same number expressed in the decimal
number system.  The input will have no more than 12 digits.
The program should terminate when the user enters 00 as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter binary number: <u>101011</u><br />
Decimal representation: 43<br />
<br />
Enter binary number: <u>0</u><br />
Decimal representation: 0<br />
<br />
Enter binary number: <u>10000101</u><br />
Decimal representation: 133<br />
<br />
Enter binary number: <u>00</u>
</tt>

<A NAME="Summing_Bin_Nums">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Summing Binary Numbers</b></A>

<p>
Develop a program that accepts as input two binary numbers and that
calculates and outputs their sum (which is also to be expressed in
binary form).  Each input will have no more than thirty digits.  
The program should repeat until both inputs are zero.

<!--  Is a description really necessary?
<p>
<b>Here we need a description of how to add two binary numbers.</b>
-->
<p>
As described in the previous problem, the binary number system is
completely analogous to the more familiar decimal number system,
in terms of how numbers are represented.
Hence, it should not be surprising that the procedure for adding
two decimal numbers (which you learned in elementary school) applies
to binary numbers as well.  

<p>
Indeed, just as with decimal numbers, we "line up" the two addends
(so that digits in corresponding positions appear one above the other)
and proceed from the rightmost (i.e., least significant) to the leftmost
(i.e., most significant) position.  (If one number has more digits than
the other, we pad the latter with leading zero's.)

<p>
For each position, we add the incoming carry to the sum of the two digits
in that position (one for each addend), yielding one of the values
zero (<em>00<sub>2</sub></em>), one (<em>01<sub>2</sub></em>), 
two (<em>10<sub>2</sub></em>), or three (<em>11<sub>2</sub></em>).
The digit of lesser significance goes into the corresponding position
of the result; the digit of greater significance is carried into
the next position.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
1st number: <u>101101011</u><br />
2nd number: <u>101101</u><br />
Sum: 110011000<br />
<br />
1st number: <u>1111</u><br />
2nd number: <u>1010</u><br />
Sum: 11001<br />
<br />
1st number: <u>0</u><br />
2nd number: <u>0</u>

<A NAME="Palindromic_Numbers">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Palindromic Numbers</b></A>

<p>
A <em>palindrome</em> is a string of characters
<!-- an expression -->
that reads the same forwards as backwards.
For example, if we ignore spaces, the phrase 
"may a moody baby doom a yam" is a palindrome.
Here, we consider those palindromes consisting entirely of the
digits 0 through 9 and not beginning with 0.
Examples are 72427, 5, and 9009.  
Any number corresponding to such a palindrome is said to be a
palindromic number.

<em>Note:</em>&nbsp; By this definition, numbers such as 3300, 
which could also be written with leading zeros as 003300, do
not qualify as being palindromic.

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a positive integer
and that reports whether or not that integer is palindromic.
The program should repeat until the user enters zero as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter number: <u>81248</u><br />
NOT PALINDROMIC<br />
<br />
Enter number: <u>4</u><br />
PALINDROMIC<br />
<br />
Enter number: <u>30</u><br />
NOT PALINDROMIC<br />
<br />
Enter number: <u>405504</u><br />
PALINDROMIC<br />
<br />
Enter number: <u>0</u>

<A NAME="Rational_Arithmetic">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Rational Arithmetic</b></A>

<p>
A <em>rational number</em> is the ratio of two integers, the second of 
which is nonzero.
We usually express such a number in the form <b><em>n/d</em></b>, 
i.e., as a fraction.
We refer to <em>n</em> as the <em>numerator</em> and 
to <em>d</em> as the <em>denominator</em>.
If <em>d</em>&gt;1 and the greatest common divisor of <em>n</em> and 
<em>d</em> is one, we say that <b><em>n/d</em></b> is in simplest form.
The simplest form of <b><em>n/1</em></b> is <em>n</em> (with no
denominator).

<p>
Most programming languages have built-in facilities for representing
and manipulating integers so that calculations performed upon them 
yield <em>exact</em> results.  The same is not true of real numbers.
Indeed, a "real" number stored in a computer is only an approximation to
the number it is intended to represent.  This is due to the fact that,
in general, to represent a real number exactly requires infinitely
many digits, whereas a computer has only a finite memory capacity.

<p>
Few programming languages have built-in facilities for dealing with
rational numbers.  
This is not necessarily an oversight:
due to the fact that all rational numbers are also real numbers, 
a programmer may use a language's built-in facilities for real numbers
in order to manipulate rationals.
Results of calculations will be only approximations, however.  
This problem challenges you to remedy this situation by developing
a program that performs <em>exact</em> arithmetic upon rational
numbers!

<p>
Write a program that accepts as input a sequence of four nonnegative
integers <em>n<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>,
<em>n<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>, 
followed by a symbol <em>op</em>, which must be one of the four basic
arithmetic operators (<b>+</b>, <b>-</b>, <b>*</b>, or <b>/</b>).
The program should evaluate the expression 
<p>
<center>
<em>
  n<sub>1</sub>/d<sub>1</sub>&nbsp; op&nbsp; 
  n<sub>2</sub>/d<sub>2</sub>
</em>
</center>
<p>
and display the result, which must be in simplest form.
The required format for input and output is illustrated below.
The program should terminate when the user enters 0 for either
of the inputs <em>d<sub>1</sub></em> or <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter Expression: <u>25 45 8 99 +</u><br />
25/45 + 8/99 = 7/11<br />
<br />
Enter Expression: <u>7 9 18 28 *</u><br />
7/9 * 18/28 = 1/2<br />
<br />
Enter Expression: <u>12 13 3 26 /</u><br />
12/13 / 3/26 = 8<br />
<br />
Enter Expression: <u>5 0 2 1 -</u><br />

<A NAME="Groceries">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Groceries: To Tax or Not To Tax</b></A>

<p>
Among the items sold at grocery stores, some are taxable and some are not.
Thus, when you make a purchase, the final bill is the sum of the
prices of the non-taxable items plus the sum of the prices of the taxable
items, plus the tax on the taxable items.

<p>
Develop a program that calculates a grocery store bill.  As input, the
user supplies the number of items purchased and, for each item, its price
(in dollars) and either <b>Y</b> or <b>N</b> to indicate whether or not,
respectively, it is taxable.
A tax rate of 6% is to be applied to the sum of the prices of the taxable
items.  Tax should be rounded to the nearest hundredth of a dollar
(i.e., cent).  Notice that in the two examples below, 6% of the cost of
the taxable items is $0.4506 and $0.4572, respectively, which round to 
$0.45 and $0.46, respectively.

The program should repeat until the user enters zero for the number of
items purchased.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Number of items purchased: <u>4</u><br />
Price of item 1: <u>2.39</u><br />

Taxable? : <u>Y</u><br />
Price of item 3: <u>4.39</u><br />
Taxable? : <u>Y</u><br />
Price of item 4: <u>2.09</u><br />
Taxable? : <u>N</u><br />
<br />
Subtotal is 11.99<br />
Tax is 0.45<br />
Grand total is 12.44<br />
