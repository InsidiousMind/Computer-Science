<b>Problem 1: What's My Score?</b></A>

<p>
Ann, Bob, Carol, and Dave played nine holes of golf together.
On the first hole, Ann teed off first, followed by Bob, then Carol,
and, finally, Dave.  At each subsequent hole, the order in which
they teed off was in accord with the usual golfing convention,
which is as follows:  The golfer with the lowest score on the
previous hole tees off first, followed by the golfer with the
second lowest score, etc., etc.  Golfers having equal scores on
the previous hole tee off in the same relative order as they did
on the previous hole.

<p>
A scorecard has four columns (one for each golfer) and nine rows
(one for each of the nine holes).
The score achieved by a given golfer on a given hole is to be
recorded in the row corresponding to that hole in the column
corresponding to that golfer.

<p>
Bob was responsible for keeping score.  He was well aware that
the scores achieved by the golfers on a given hole were to be
recorded on the scorecard in the row corresponding to that hole.
Unfortunately, he did not possess a proper understanding of the
purpose of the four columns on the scorecard!  He thought that
the first column was for recording the score of the golfer who 
teed off first on the given hole, the second column was for 
recording the score of the golfer who teed off second on the 
given hole, etc., etc.  Thus, in each row of the scorecard,
Bob recorded the correct scores, but (usually, at least)
in the wrong columns.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input the scorecard
filled out by Bob and that produces as output the "correct"
scorecard.

<p>
As illustrated in the example below, your program should prompt
the user to enter Bob's original scorecard.  The user shall enter
nine lines of data, each containing four positive integers separated
from each other by at least one space.  Your program should then
display the correct scorecard, with one column showing hole
numbers and four subsequent columns in which the scores of 
Ann, Bob, Carol, and Dave are displayed, in that order.  Each
golfer's total score (the sum of the scores on the nine holes)
should be displayed at the bottom of her/his column.

<b>Problem 2: Spiral of Squares</b></A>

<p>
Imagine a grid whose cells have been numbered, starting at zero, in
the outwardly-spiraling pattern illustrated below.  Imagine
that the spiral extends out to infinity.

<p>

<pre>
               56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64
               55 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 65
               54 29 12 13 14 15 16 37 66
               53 28 11  2  3  4 17 38 67
               52 27 10  1  0  5 18 39 68
               51 26  9  8  7  6 19 40 69

               80 79 78 77 76 75 74 73 72
</pre>

<p>
You are to develop a program that, given as input two nonnegative integers 
j and k, with neither exceeding 1000, outputs the distance on the grid
between the cells numbered j and k.

<p>
By <em>distance between two cells </em> we mean the fewest number of steps 
by which it is possible to get from one to the other, assuming that in each 
step we can move one position in a horizontal or vertical
(but <b>not</b> diagonal) direction.

<p>
End of input is signaled when both inputs are zero.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>
<tt> 
<p>
  Enter two inputs:<br>
  <u>15  42</u><br>

<A NAME="Hill_Removal">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Hill Removal</b></A>

<p>
A sequence of three or more integers whose members are in 
strictly increasing or strictly decreasing order is called 
a <em>hill </em>.  
(For example, 2, 5, 8, 9 and 5, 3,-1 are hills.
However, 4, 7, 7, 12 is not, because its 3rd member is no greater
than its 2nd.)

<p>
A sequence of integers that is not itself a hill may contain one or
more contiguous subsequences that <em>are </em> hills.
For example, the sequence 5,3,5,9,7,4,1,2 contains as subsequences
the hills 3,5,9 and 9,7,4 and 7,4,1 and 9,7,4,1.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a sequence of integers,
rearranges them so that the resulting sequence contains no
contiguous subsequences that are hills.
For each input sequence, the user shall enter its length followed by the sequence itself (as illustrated below).
Each number in the sequence will be separated from the next by at least
one space.  End of input is signaled by a sequence length of zero.
The user shall not enter a sequence of length exceeding twenty.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>
<tt> 
<p>
  Enter length of sequence: <u>9</u><br>
  Enter sequence: <u>5 8 5 3 7 9 12 6 8</u><br>

  Enter length of sequence: <u>0</u>

<A NAME="Num_Rep_Factorial_Base">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Number Representation in the Factorial Base</b></A>

<p>
For a positive integer m, we define 
m! = 1 &sdot; 2 &sdot; 3 &sdot;&nbsp; ... &nbsp;&sdot; m.
That is, m! is the product of the positive integers 1 through m.
(This is the well known <em>factorial </em> function.)

<p>
Interestingly, for every positive integer k there exists a unique sequence
of nonnegative integers d<sub>1</sub>, d<sub>2</sub>, ..., d<sub>n</sub>, 
(where d<sub>j</sub>  &le; j for all j) such that 

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
k = d<sub>1</sub> &sdot;1! &nbsp;+&nbsp; d<sub>2</sub> &sdot;2!
&nbsp;+&nbsp; d<sub>3</sub> &sdot;3! &nbsp;+&nbsp; ... &nbsp;+&nbsp;
d<sub>n</sub> &sdot;n!</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>


      
<p>
In the factorial base number system, the number k would be represented by
the sequence of "digits"
d<sub>n</sub> d<sub>n-1</sub> ... d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>1</sub>.
For example, the number that we express as 523 in the standard decimal
number system would be expressed by 41301 in the factorial base,
corresponding to the fact that

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
523 &nbsp;&nbsp; =  &nbsp;&nbsp;1 &sdot; 1! &nbsp;+&nbsp; 0 &sdot; 2!
&nbsp;+&nbsp; 3 &sdot; 3! &nbsp;+&nbsp; 1 &sdot; 4! &nbsp;+&nbsp; 4 &sdot; 5!
&nbsp;&nbsp; =  &nbsp;&nbsp;1 + 0 + 18 + 24 + 480</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>



<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a positive integer and that 
produces as ouput its representation in the factorial base number
system, as illustrated below.
(<em>Note: </em> The "digits" in the output may be separated
by spaces.)
End of input is signaled by the user entering zero.

<p>
You may assume that the user shall enter no input value whose
factorial base representation requires more than seven digits.

<p>
<em>Hint: </em> By repeatedly applying the distributive property of multiplication
over addition, you will find that the number 
<p><center>
k = d<sub>1</sub> &sdot; 1! &nbsp;+&nbsp;d<sub>2</sub> &sdot; 2!
 &nbsp;+&nbsp; ... &nbsp;+&nbsp;d<sub>n</sub> &sdot; n!
</center>
can also be written as follows:

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
k = d<sub>1</sub> + 2(d<sub>2</sub> + 3(d<sub>3</sub> + 4(d<sub>4</sub> + 
... + (n-1)(d<sub>n-1</sub> + n &sdot;d<sub>n</sub>) ... )</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>


Thus, for instance, to determine the digit d<sub>1</sub>, it suffices to take the 
remainder of the division k/2.  The remaining digits can be determined
by carrying out more divisions, using the same idea.
<em>End of Hint. </em>

<A NAME="No_Hassle_Auto_Insurance">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: No Hassle Auto Insurance</b></A>

<p>
The No Hassle Auto Insurance company believes that everyone
deserves a second chance, and therefore it does not raise the
rate of a driver after he is involved in his first accident
or receives his first ticket.  However, the rate <em>will </em> increase
for a driver involved in a second accident or receiving a second ticket.
A driver whose number of accidents plus tickets exceeds four is uninsurable.

<p>
The basic formula for the rate charged by the No Hassle company is

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
r = 0.02 &sdot; c &sdot; a! &sdot; t! &sdot; y</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>


where c stands for the value of the car (see below), 
a stands for number of accidents, 
t stands for number of tickets received, and
y stands for the <em>age multiplier </em> (see below).

<p>
Recall that 0! = 1 and, 
for m &gt; 0, m! = 1 &sdot; 2 &sdot; 3 &sdot; ...  &sdot; m
(i.e., the product of the integers 1 through m).
This is the well known factorial function.

<p>
To calculate c (the value of the car), the purchase price and age of
the car are required.  Specifically, the value of a car of age zero
is its purchase price.  The value of a car of age greater than zero
is 90 percent of its previous year's value. 

<p>
To calculate y, we need the driver's age.  Specifically, for a driver
between the ages of 16 and 24, y = 3.  For ages 25 through 34, y = 1.5.
For ages 35 through 44, y = 1.  For ages, 45 through 64, y = 1.5.
For ages 65 and above, y = 3.

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input the purchase price and age of a car,
the age of its driver, the number of accidents in which the driver has
been involved, and the number of tickets the driver has received.
(All these will be nonnegative integers.)
As output, the program should display the insurance rate for the driver or
a message indicating that she is uninsurable.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution (1):</b><br>
<tt> 
<p>
  Enter purchase price of car: <u>20000</u><br>
  Enter age of car: <u>3</u><br>
  Enter age of driver: <u>26</u><br>
  Enter number of accidents: <u>0</u><br>
  Enter number of tickets: <u>2</u><br>

<A NAME="Lax_Security">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Lax Security</b></A>

<p>
The Lax Hazardous Waste Company must maintain a certain level of
security at its plant because of the nature of the materials
handled there.  The main door to the plant has a keypad similar
to the one shown below.  To open the door, an employee must
first enter her five-digit personal identification number (PIN).
If the PIN is valid, the door opens.  Otherwise, it does not.

<pre>
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                     | 1 | | 2 | | 3 |
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                     | 4 | | 5 | | 6 |
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                     | 7 | | 8 | | 9 |
                     +---+ +---+ +---+
                           +---+
                           | 0 |
                           +---+ </pre>

<p>
However, Bocefus Lax, the company owner, is a nice guy who doesn't like
to burden his employees unnecessarily.  The digits on the keypad are
close together and employees often enter their PIN incorrectly by
pressing an adjacent button instead of the intended one.  Therefore,
he wants to modify the access system so that it allows an employee
to open the door even if the PIN they enter is slightly incorrect.
Specifically, Bocefus is willing to assume that the person using the
keypad is a valid employee if the number entered has no more than one
digit that is off-by-one from some valid PIN.  Here, off-by-one
means that, with respect to the keypad, the incorrect digit is either
immediately above, below, to the right of, or to the left of the 
correct digit.  (For example, the digits that are off-by-one from 4
are 1, 5, and 7.)

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a list of valid PINs followed
by a list of numbers that were entered on the keypad.  For each number
in the latter list, the program should report whether it is accepted
or rejected.  For each accepted number, the program reports which 
valid PIN it matches (exactly or approximately).

<p>
Note that a number entered on the keypad could match more than one
valid PIN.  For example, the PIN 22222 is off-by-one from 21222,
52222, 22223, and many others.  If a number entered on the keypad
matches a valid PIN exactly, that PIN should be identified.
If not, but if the number approximately matches some valid PIN,
report the first such valid PIN in the list.

<p>
End of input is signaled by the user entering all zeros.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b><br>
<tt> 
<p>
  Enter number of valid PINs: <u>4</u><br>
  <u>10360<br>

  Enter a number: <u>39491</u><br>
  Matches 39491<br><br>
  Enter a number: <u>36491</u><br>
  Matches 39491<br><br>
  Enter a number: <u>14543</u><br>
  No matches<br><br>
