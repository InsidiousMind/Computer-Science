<b>Problem 1: Min/Max Search</b>


<p>
Develop a program that, given a sequence S of integers as input, produces
as output two sequences of positive integers, the first of which indicates
all those positions in S at which S's minimum value occurs and the second
of which indicates all those positions at which S's maximum value occurs.
Positions are numbered starting at one (1).

<p>
<b>Input</b>

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer m indicating how many
sequences are to be processed.  The next 2m lines contain descriptions of
the m sequences, two lines per sequence.  The first line of each description
contains a positive integer n &le; 40) indicating the length of (i.e.,
number of values in) the sequence, and the second line contains the values
in the sequence.
Each such value is separated from the next by at least one space.

<p>
<b>Output</b>

<p>
For each sequence given as input, there should be four lines of output.
The first line echos the given sequence.
The second line indicates the positions at which the minimum value occurs.
The third line indicates the positions at which the maximum value occurs.
The fourth line is blank.

<b>Problem 2: Follow the Yellow Brick Road</b>


<p>
Consider the following, which is intended to depict a string
M = <tt>OELRO!LWLH D</tt> with characters occupying positions
one through twelve and a sequence S of integers whose elements
occupy positions zero through twelve.
M is a scrambled message and S, if interpreted properly,
provides a ``roadmap'' for unscrambling M.

<pre>
  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12
 -----------------------------------------
     O  E  L  R  O  !  L  W  L   H       D
 10 10  5 -2  5 -1  0 -4 -3  3  -8  -3  -6 
</pre>
The zero-th element of S, 10, tells us that we should begin at
position ten.  As <tt>H</tt> occupies position ten of M, it is
the first character in the unscrambled message.
As <font face="symbol">-</font
>8 occupies position ten of S, we move eight places
to the left (i.e., to position two) in order to find the
next character, which is <tt>E</tt>.  We find that 5 occupies
position two of S; hence we move five positions to the right
(i.e., to position seven) to find the next character, which is
<tt>L</tt>.  We continue in this fashion until reaching a
position of S occupied by 0; the character in the corresponding
position of M is the last character in the unscrambled message.
For this example, the unscrambled message you obtain is
<tt>HELLO WORLD!</tt>.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input some scrambled messages
together with integer sequences to be used as roadmaps in
unscrambling them, outputs the unscrambled messages.

<p>
<b>Input</b>

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer n indicating
how many scrambled messages are to be unscrambled.
The following 3n lines contain descriptions of the scrambled
messages and the roadmaps for unscrambling them.
Each such description occupies three lines,
the first containing a positive integer m (m  <font face="symbol">£</font
> 40)
indicating the length of the message, the second containing the
message itself (a string of length m), and the third containing
a sequence of m+1 integers to be used for unscrambling.

<p>
You may assume that the input data is such that the unscrambling
process, as described above, will never lead you to a position
that is ``out of bounds'' (i.e., less than one or greater than m).
You may also assume that the input data will not cause this process
to enter an infinite loop.

<p>
<b>Output</b>

<p>
For each scrambled message, simply display the string obtained
by unscrambling it.
Note that it is possible for the unscrambled message to be shorter
than the scrambled one.  (See sample below.)

<b>Problem 3: L-I-N-G-O</b>


<p>
A current TV game show asks contestants to guess at hidden five-letter words.
Contestants are told the first letter of the word and are allowed to make
up to five guesses at the word.
Feedback is provided in response to each guess, as contestants
are told which letters in the guessed word also occur in the hidden word
and, for each such letter, whether it occurs in the same position in
the two words.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a number of ``games'', each
described by a hidden five-letter word followed by some guesses
(all of which are five letters in length), produces as output
the appropriate feedback for each guess, plus the ``initial feedback''
that is given before the first guess is made.
The feedback for a guess is the guess itself (in upper case), except
that any letter occurring in the guess that fails to occur in the
hidden word is replaced by a period (<tt>.</tt>) and any letter
occurring in the guess that occurs in the hidden word,
<em>but not in the same position</em>, is replaced by the lower case
version of that letter.

<p>
As an example, suppose that the hidden word starts with <tt>A</tt>.
Then the initial feedback would be <tt>A....</tt> .
Suppose that our first guess is <tt>APPLE</tt>, which (aside from the
first letter) is similar to the hidden word only in that they both
contain <tt>L</tt>, but in different positions.  The resulting feedback
would be <tt>A..l.</tt> .
Looking for more help, we next try the word <tt>AMIGO</tt>, 
whose only similarity to the hidden word (aside from the first letter)
is that <tt>I</tt> appears in the same position.  The resulting feedback
is <tt>A.I..</tt> .  Working with the <tt>I</tt>, we next try the word 
<tt>ASIAN</tt>.  The <tt>I</tt> is still correctly placed, but now so too
is the (second) <tt>A</tt>.  In addition, <tt>S</tt> occurs in both
words, but in different positions.  Hence, we get as feedback
<tt>AsIA.</tt> .  From these clues, plus the clue regarding <tt>L</tt> 
obtained as a result of the first guess, it follows that the hidden word is 
<tt>ALIAS</tt>, which we make our fourth guess.  The resulting
feedback is <tt>ALIAS</tt> (indicating an exact match),
which ends the game.

<p>
<b>Input</b> 

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer n indicating
how many games are to be played. 
Each game is described by a ``hidden'' five-letter word, followed
by at most five guesses, each of which is a five-letter word.
Each word appears on a line by itself, left justified and
entirely in upper case.
Any guess that is correct is the last guess of that game.
If no guess is correct, the last guess is the fifth one.

<p>
The last guess of one game is separated from the hidden word of
the next game by a blank line containing at least one space.

<p>
<b>Output</b> 

<p>
The first line of output for each game contains the ``initial feedback'',
which is the first letter of the hidden word followed by four periods.
Each subsequent line of output for that game contains the feedback in
response to the corresponding guess (as described above).
A single blank line should appear between the outputs for two consecutive
games.

<b>Problem 4: Goldbach's Conjecture</b>


<p>
A <em>prime</em> number is a positive integer having exactly two
divisors among the positive integers (namely, itself and one).
The first several primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.
(Note that 1 is <em>not prime</em>, as it has only one divisor
(namely itself) among the positive integers.)

<p>
In a letter to Euler in 1742, Christian Goldbach conjectured that
every even integer greater than two is the sum of two prime numbers.
Euler agreed that the conjecture was probably true, but, despite the
efforts of a number of mathematicians over the past two hundred sixty
years, no one has yet been able to prove or disprove it.
Recently, with the help of electronic computers, it has been shown
that the conjecture holds for numbers up to 4 &times;10<sup>14</sup>.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a list of even integers greater
than two (but no greater than one thousand), produces as output,
for each number in the list, 
every pair of prime numbers that sum to it.

<p>
<b>Input</b>

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer n
indicating how many numbers are to be processed.  On each of
the next n lines is an even integer greater than two (but
no greater than 1000).

<p>
<b>Output</b>

<p>
For each of the n numbers given as input, that number should
be displayed on one line.  On the following lines, every distinct pair
of primes summing to it should be displayed, one pair per line,
with the smaller of the two primes in each pair listed first.
The pairs should be listed in increasing order with respect to the 
smaller prime in each one.
Following that should be a blank line.

<b>Problem 5: Decimal to Base Fibonacci Conversion</b>


<p>
Let us define the fibonacci sequence f<sub>0</sub>, f<sub>1</sub>, f<sub>2</sub>, ... as follows: 
f<sub>0</sub> = 1, f<sub>1</sub> = 2, and, for k &gt; 1, f<sub>k</sub> = f<sub>k<font face="symbol">-</font
>2</sub> + f<sub>k<font face="symbol">-</font
>1</sub>. 
That is, the first two elements are 1 and 2, respectively, and
each element thereafter is the sum of the two elements preceding it.
The sequence begins as follows:

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...</td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<p>
In the decimal (i.e., base 10) number system, the numeral 57082
(for example) has value 

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
2 &#183;10<sup>0</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;8 &#183;10<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;0 &#183;10<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp; 7 &#183;10<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;5 &#183;10<sup>4</sup></td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>


That is, the value of a numeral is obtained by multiplying each
of its digits by the appropriate power of 10 (beginning at 10<sup>0</sup>
for the rightmost digit) and adding up the results.  Writing this
more generally, we have that the value of the n-digit numeral
d<sub>n<font face="symbol">-</font
>1</sub> d<sub>n<font face="symbol">-</font
>2</sub> <font face="symbol">¼</font
>d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>0</sub> (where each d<sub>i</sub> is one of
the ten digits 0 through 9) is

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
d<sub>0</sub> &#183;10<sup>0</sup> &nbsp;+ 
&nbsp;d<sub>1</sub> &#183;10<sup>1</sup> 
&nbsp;+ &nbsp; ... &nbsp;+ &nbsp; d<sub>n-2</sub>
&#183;10<sup>n-2</sup> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;d<sub>n-1</sub>
&#183;10<sup>n-1</sup> </td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<p>
Consider using the Fibonacci numbers as the ``weights'' of the columns
in a numeral, rather than using the powers of ten.  That is, suppose
that we interpret an n-digit numeral
d<sub>n-1</sub> d<sub>n-2</sub> ... d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>0</sub>
as having value

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>
<table align="center"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" align="center">
d<sub>0</sub> &#183;f<sub>0</sub> &nbsp;+ 
&nbsp;d<sub>1</sub> &#183;f<sub>1</sub> &nbsp;+ 
&nbsp; ... &nbsp;+ &nbsp; d<sub>n-2</sub> 
&#183;f<sub>n-2</sub> &nbsp;+ &nbsp;d<sub>n-1</sub> 
&#183;f<sub>n-1</sub> </td></tr></table>
</td></tr></table>



<p>
It turns out that, even if we limit ourselves to using the two digits
0 and 1,
every positive integer can be expressed in this way!
For example, 
111010<sub>fib</sub> 
(the subscript indicates that this is a
``base-fibonacci'' numeral) would be evaluated as follows:

<p>

<br clear="all" /><table border="0" width="100%"><tr><td>

<p>
Note that, unlike the decimal number system, it is possible for
two different base-fibonacci numerals, neither having leading zeros, 
to represent the same number.
For example, 10000<sub>fib</sub>, 1100<sub>fib</sub>, and 1011<sub>fib</sub> all
represent the number that is written as 8 in decimal.
Indeed, within a base-fibonacci numeral, any occurrence of 100
may be replaced by 011, or vice versa, without changing the value
associated with that numeral.
(This is so because the sum of the weights of the two less
significant digits among the three is equal to the weight of the
most significant digit among the three.)

<p>
We say that a base-fibonacci numeral is in
<em>canonical form</em> if it has no leading zeros and includes
no occurrences of 100 among its digits.
Two different canonical-form base-fibonacci
numerals necessarily represent two different numbers.

<p>
Develop a program that, given a list of positive integers (written
in the usual decimal notation) as input, produces as output the
same values expressed as canonical-form base-fibonacci numerals.

<p>
<b>Input</b>

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer n,
indicating how many numbers are to be processed.
Each of the next n lines contains a positive integer no
greater than one thousand (1000).

<p>
<b>Output</b>

<p>
For each of the n integers given as input, display it on one line,
display the corresponding canonical-form base-fibonacci number
on the next, and make the next line blank.

<b>Problem 6: Overlapping Taping Schedules</b>


<p>
The digital video recorder (DVR) is becoming a popular item for
home entertainment systems.  One of the benefits of a DVR compared to the
older video cassette recorder (VCR) is that the former, unlike the latter,
is capable of taping two or more shows simultaneously.

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input the taping schedule of a DVR
and determines the time periods during which the machine will be required
to tape two or more shows simultaneously.

<p>
<b>Input</b>

<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer m
indicating how many taping schedules are to be analyzed.
Subsequent lines of input contain descriptions of m
taping schedules.

<p>
Each description of a taping schedule begins with a
line containing a positive integer n (n  <font face="symbol">£</font
> 50)
indicating the number of shows on that schedule.
Each of the next n lines contains a day-time interval
during which a particular show is to be recorded.
A day-time interval consists of a starting 
day-time and an ending day-time, separated by a space.
A day-time consists of a three-letter abbreviation for 
a day of the week
(i.e., one of <tt>SUN</tt>, <tt>MON</tt>, <tt>TUE</tt>, <tt>WED</tt>,
<tt>THU</tt>, <tt>FRI</tt>, or <tt>SAT</tt>), followed by a space, 
followed by the time of day, expressed in ``military time'',
i.e., as a four-digit sequence whose first two digits are in
the range 00..23 (indicating the number of hours since midnight)
and whose last two digits are in the range 00..59
(indicating the number of minutes since the beginning of the
current hour).  In order to simplify matters, you may assume
that, in any day-time given as input, the last two digits
are either 00, 15, 30, or 45.

<p>
The day-time intervals given as input should be assumed to
fall within the same week but should not be assumed
to be in any particular order.

<p>
<b>Output</b>

<p>
For each schedule given as input, your program should produce as
output a <em>minimum-length</em> list of day-time intervals covering
exactly the time periods during which the DVR is scheduled to
record two or more shows simultaneously.
These day-time intervals should be listed in chronological order,
one per line, beginning with Sunday at midnight
(i.e., when Saturday turns into Sunday).

<p>
The results for each schedule should be preceded by a message
like that shown in the sample output below.  The results for
each schedule should be followed by a blank line.

<p>
<b>Sample input</b>
