<b>Problem 1: Fibonacci Roots</b></A>

<p>
The first two terms in the <em>Fibonacci sequence</em> are 0 and 1, 
respectively, and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two.
Using this definition to calculate the first several terms in the sequence,
we get 
<p>
<center>
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
</center>

<p>
Let us define the <em>Fibonacci roots</em> of a positive integer <em>n</em>
to be the two smallest consecutive Fibonacci numbers whose sum is greater
than or equal to <em>n</em>.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a positive integer, produces as
output its Fibonacci roots.  The program should repeat until the user
enters zero as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter input: <u>31</u><br />
Fibonacci roots: 13 21<br />
<br />
Enter input: <u>89</u><br />
Fibonacci roots: 34 55<br />
<br />
Enter input: <u>0</u>

<hr>
<b>Problem 2: Determine the Mode</b></A>

<p>
In statistics, the <em>mode</em> of a collection of values is defined to be
any value that occurs with highest frequency in the collection.
The mode need not be unique, as there may be two or more values that occur
with the same highest frequency.


<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a collection of integers, lists
any that qualify as a mode of the collection.  The program should repeat
until the user indicates that the collection of numbers to be analyzed
is empty.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter number of items in the collection: <u>16</u><br />
Enter item 1: <u>12</u><br />
Enter item 2: <u>-34</u><br />
Enter item 3: <u>12</u><br />
Enter item 4: <u>9868</u><br />
Enter item 5: <u>89</u><br />
Enter item 6: <u>23</u><br />
Enter item 7: <u>28973</u><br />
Enter item 8: <u>88</u><br />
Enter item 9: <u>-7</u><br />
Enter item 10: <u>12</u><br />
Enter item 11: <u>-7</u><br />
Enter item 12: <u>-3435</u><br />
Enter item 13: <u>23</u><br />
Enter item 14: <u>0</u><br />
Enter item 15: <u>23</u><br />
Enter item 16: <u>88</u><br />

<A NAME="Subset_Determination">

<b>Problem 3: Subset Determination</b></A>

<p>
A <em>set</em> is collection of elements, or members.
A set <b>S</b> is said to be a <em>subset of </em> the set <b>T</b>
if every member of <b>S</b> is also a member of <b>T</b>.
<b>S</b> is said to be a <em>proper subset of </em> <b>T</b>
if <b>S</b> is a subset of <b>T</b> and, in addition,
at least one of the members of <b>T</b> is not a member of <b>S</b>.

<p>
Develop a program that determines whether one set of identifiers
(strings containing only upper case letters) is a proper subset of another.
The user enters the identifiers in each set all at once, with the identifiers
separated by commas and with the entire list enclosed in parentheses.
No set given as input will contain more than ten members, and no 
identifier will be longer than twelve characters.
The output is simply <b>YES</b> or <b>NO</b>, the former if the second
set is a proper subset of the first and the latter otherwise.
The program should repeat until the user enters as a first set one
containing no members.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter 1st set: <u>(APPLE,GRAPE,PEAR,ORANGE,GRAPEFRUIT)</u><br />
Enter 2nd set: <u>(ORANGE,GRAPE)</u><br />
YES<br />
<br />
Enter 1st set: <u>(APPLE,GRAPE,PEAR,ORANGE,GRAPEFRUIT)</u><br />
Enter 2nd set: <u>(ORANGE,BANANA,GRAPE)</u><br />
NO<br />
<br />
Enter 1st set: <u>()</u>

<A NAME="Tiling">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Tiling</b></A>

<p>
When contractors lay floor tile in a rectangular room, they should 
make sure that each tile on the perimeter has the same size as the one
on the opposite side of the room.
This gives a more appealing look to the final result.

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input
<ul>
  <li>the dimensions (i.e., length and width) of a 
      rectangular floor area,</li>
  <li>the size (i.e., length of each side) of the square tiles 
      to be laid on the floor, and</li>
  <li>the grout gap (i.e., the distance between adjacent tiles 
      due to grouting),</li>
</ul>
reports the number of full and partial tiles needed to cover
the floor, as well as the dimensions of the partial tiles.
(All measurements are expressed in the same unit of distance, e.g., inches).
The program should repeat until the user enters zero as the
floor length.

<p>
Partial tiles are ones that have been cut in order to reduce either 
their length, their width, or both.  Such tiles are to be laid only
on the perimeter of the floor.
(The only tiles that need to be cut twice &mdash;in order to reduce
both length <em>and </em> width&mdash; are corner tiles, the number 
of which is always either zero or four.)

<p>
Tiles are to be laid out so that grout gaps exist only between
adjacent tiles, and never at the perimeter of the floor area.
Thus, the number of tiles in any "row" or "column" is always exactly one
greater than the number of grout gaps.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter floor length: <u>25.0</u><br />
Enter floor width: <u>19.0</u><br />
Enter length/width of tiles: <u>4.75</u><br />
Enter grout gap: <u>0.25</u><br />
<br />
12 full tiles<br />
6 length-reduced tiles of length 2.375<br />
8 width-reduced tiles of width 1.875<br />
4 corner tiles<br />
<br />
Enter floor length: <u>324.5</u><br />
Enter floor width: <u>200.0</u><br />
Enter length/width of tile: <u>6.0</u><br />
Enter grout gap: <u>0.5</u><br />
<br />
1500 full tiles<br />
0 length-reduced tiles<br />
100 width-reduced tiles of width 2.25<br />
0 corner tiles<br />
<br />
Enter floor length: <u>128.8</u><br />
Enter floor width: <u>171.8</u><br />
Enter length/width of tile: <u>4.1</u><br />
Enter grout gap: <u>0.2</u><br />
<br />
1200 full tiles<br />
0 length-reduced tiles<br />
0 width-reduced tiles<br />
0 corner tiles<br />
<br />
Enter floor length: <u>0.0</u>

<b>Problem 6: Speeders Beware</b></A>

<p>
Write a program that, given as input
<ul>
  <li>the distance (in feet) between two "checkpoints",</li>
  <li>the time (in seconds) taken by an automobile to travel from
      the first checkpoint to the second, and</li>
  <li>the speed limit (in miles per hour)</li>
</ul>
determines whether or not the average speed of the automobile 
---in traveling from one checkpoint to the other---
exceeded the speed limit.  All inputs are real numbers.
The program should repeat until the user enters zero for the
distance between checkpoints.

<p>
<b>Reminder:</b>
There are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter distance between checkpoints: <u>50.0</u><br />
Enter time between checkpoints: <u>0.6</u><br />
Enter speed limit: <u>55.0</u><br />

Enter distance between checkpoints: <u>2.5</u><br />
Enter time between checkpoints: <u>0.035</u><br />
Enter speed limit: <u>55.0</u><br />

Enter distance between checkpoints: <u>0.0</u>
