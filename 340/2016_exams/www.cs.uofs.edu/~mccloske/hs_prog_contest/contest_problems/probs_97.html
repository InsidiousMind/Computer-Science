<b>Problem 1: Lines in a Plane</b></A>

<p>
In euclidean geometry, two lines on a plane are related in exactly one 
of three ways: The two lines either
<ul>
  <li>have no points in common, in which case they are said to be 
      <b>parallel</b>, or</li>
  <li>have a single point in common, in which case they are said to be
      <b>intersecting</b>, or</li>
  <li>have all their points in common, in which case they are said to 
      <b>coincide</b>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input two lines (each described
by a pair of points on the cartesian coordinate plane) and that reports 
which of the three possible relationships holds between the two lines.
The user supplies as input the eight real numbers
x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>,
x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>,
x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>,
x<sub>4</sub>, and y<sub>4</sub>.
The eight numbers represent two lines: the line through the points
(x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>) and
the line through the points
(x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>) and (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>).

<p>
After providing its output, the program should ask whether the user
wishes to submit another instance of the problem.  The user is to
reply either "yes" or "no"; in response, the program should take 
the appropriate action.

<A NAME="Union_Intersect_Sets">

<b>Problem 2: Union and Intersection of Sets</b></A>

<p>
In mathematics, a set is any collection of objects in which no object appears
more than once.  One could speak about the set of whole numbers, or the set of
students in a class, or the set of molecules in a drop of water.
A common way of describing a small set is to list its members, enclosing
them within curly braces.  For example, { a, e, i, o, u } is the set of vowels
in our alphabet.  The order in which the members are listed is irrelevant,
so we also could express this set as { i, u, a, o, e }.

<p>
The <b>intersection</b> of two sets is defined to be the set consisting of
all objects that appear in both sets.  For example, the intersection of
{ 1, 2, 4, 5, 12 } and { 3, 4, 9, 12, 17, 22 } is { 4, 12 }.

<p>
The <b>union</b> of two sets is defined to be the set consisting of all 
objects that appear in either of the two sets.  For example, the union of
{ Fred, Alice, Joe } and { Emily, Mary, Fred } is 
{ Mary, Fred, Alice, Emily, Joe }.  

<p>
You are to develop a program that asks the user to input two sets;
the program then displays the two sets, followed by their intersection
and their union.  To input a set, the user enters the size of the
set (i.e., the number of distinct members), followed by each member of the
set, as in the example below.  The user is not to enter the same
member twice.  The program should repeat until the user enters -1 as
the size of the first set.

<p>
You may assume that no set given as input by the user contains more
than twenty (20) members.  You may also assume that no item entered
by the user has length more than eight characters.  In outputting a
set, your program may list its members in any order.  In place of
curly braces, you may use parentheses.  Commas between members are
optional.
Finally, be sure that your program handles the empty set (i.e., the 
set with no members) correctly.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
Enter size of first set: <u>3</u><br>
Enter item 1 of first set: <u>Charles</u><br>
Enter item 2 of first set: <u>garage</u><br>
Enter item 3 of first set: <u>55</u><br>
Enter size of second set: <u>0</u><br>
The first set is { Charles, garage, 55 }<br>
The second set is {  }<br>
Their intersection is {  }<br>
Their union is { Charles, garage, 55 }<br>
<br>
Enter size of first set: <u>3</u><br>
Enter item 1 of first set: <u>A</u><br>
Enter item 2 of first set: <u>BB</u><br>
Enter item 3 of first set: <u>CCC</u><br>
Enter size of second set: <u>4</u><br>
Enter item 1 of second set: <u>A</u><br>
Enter item 2 of second set: <u>E</u><br>
Enter item 3 of second set: <u>BB</u><br>
Enter item 4 of second set: <u>RR</u><br>
The first set is { A, BB, CCC }<br>
The second set is { A, E, BB, RR }<br>
Their intersection is { A, BB }<br>
Their union is { A, BB, CCC, E, RR }<br>
<br>
Enter size of first set: <u>-1</u>

<A NAME="Bakery_Scheduling">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Bakery Scheduling</b></A>

<p>
A baker wishes to arise in the morning and enter into her computer
the list of  <!-- orders she is to fulfill -->
baking tasks that she must complete
that day, how long each will take,
and at what time of day each is "due" to be finished, so that 
the computer can produce an effective schedule of her day.
You are to develop a scheduling program for the baker to use.
It must produce a schedule according to a few simple rules:
<ul>
  <li>The baker works from 8:00am until noon, at which time she
      takes a lunch break.  She cannot go to lunch with a 
      baking task "in progress", for then the baked good would burn.</li>
  <li>The baker returns from lunch at 1:00pm and works until 5:00pm,
      at which time she stops working.</li>
  <li>Each baking task must be completed no later than its due time
      (which is when the customer can be expected to arrive to
      pick it up).</li>
  <li>At most one baking task can be in progress at any one time, and
      once such a task has been started, it must continue, uninterrupted,
      to completion.</li>
</ul>
The baker will input the number of baking tasks she has for the day,
which you may assume is no more than eight.  Then she will input, for each 
task, its "name" (a description of no longer than forty characters), 
its due time, and its duration (how long it will take).
Times of day will be given in the standard format,
&lt;hours&gt;:&lt;minutes&gt; (e.g., 8:00, 11:30).
Durations will be given in units of hours, to the nearest half hour.
<!--  No task may have a duration greater than four hours. -->
You may assume that the baking tasks entered as input by the user 
are such that it is possible to complete all of them (in one day) in 
accord with the rules given above.
The schedule produced as output by your program should list, for each 
baking task, its name together with its starting and ending times,
in chronological order.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter number of orders: <u>4</u><br>
Enter name of order 1: <u>Jones wedding cake</u><br>
Enter due time of order 1: <u>12:00</u><br>
Enter duration of order 1: <u>2.0</u><br>
Enter name of order 2: <u>Fortucci Restaurant bread</u><br>
Enter due time of order 2: <u>11:00</u><br>
Enter duration of order 2: <u>1.0</u><br>
Enter name of order 3: <u>Cookie Monster cookies</u><br>
Enter due time of order 3: <u>3:30</u><br>
Enter duration of order 3: <u>2.5</u><br>
Enter name of order 4: <u>Smith family doughnuts</u><br>
Enter due time of order 4: <u>4:00</u><br>
Enter duration of order 4: <u>1.0</u><br>
<br>
Work on Fortucci Restaurant bread from 8:00 to 9:00<br>
Work on Jones wedding cake from 9:00 to 11:00<br>
Work on Smith family doughnuts from 11:00 to 12:00<br>
Work on Cookie Monster cookies from 1:00 to 3:30

<A NAME="Permutation_Representation">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Permutation Representation</b></A>

<p>
A <b>permutation</b> is a sequence of <em>n</em> integers
(<em>a<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>a<sub>2</sub></em>, 
<em>a<sub>3</sub></em>, ..., <em>a<sub>n</sub></em>)
in which each of the integers between 1 and <em>n</em> appears exactly once.
(The number <em>n</em> can be any positive integer.)
One can view a permutation 
as a function <em>f </em> such that, for each <em>i</em> between
1 and <em>n</em>, <em>f(i)</em> = <em>a<sub>i</sub></em>.
(That is, <em>f </em> maps each position into the value at that position.)
For example, the function <em>f </em> corresponding to the permutation 
(3, 6, 5, 4, 1, 2) is such that 
<em>f</em>(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3, <em>f</em>(2)&nbsp;=&nbsp;6,
<em>f</em>(3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, ..., and <em>f</em>(6)&nbsp;=&nbsp;2.

<p>
It turns out that every permutation is simply a collection of <b>cycles</b>.
A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that if <em>f</em> is applied to any
except the last of them, it yields the next one, and if <em>f</em> is 
applied to the last one, it yields the first.
<!-- &lt; <em>i<sub>1</sub>, i<sub>2</sub>, ...
     i<sub>k</sub></em>&gt; such that
     <em>f(i<sub>1</sub>) = i<sub>2</sub></em>,
     <em>f(i<sub>2</sub>) = i<sub>3</sub></em>, ...,
     <em>f(i<sub>k</sub>) = i<sub>1</sub></em>.   -->
Thus, the permutation given above has as one of its cycles
&lt;1, 3, 5&gt;, because <em>f</em>(1)&nbsp;=&nbsp;3,
<em>f</em>(3)&nbsp;=&nbsp;5, and <em>f</em>(5)&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.
Its other two cycles are &lt;2, 6&gt; and &lt;4&gt;.

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a permutation of length no more
than 16 (in the manner illustrated below) and that outputs the 
<b>cyclic representation</b> of that permutation.
The cyclic representation of a permutation is simply a list of the 
cycles of which it is composed.  Your output should list each cycle,
one per line, with its smallest element first.  Cycles should be listed
in increasing order with respect to their smallest elements.

<p>
The program should repeat until the user specifies that the next
permutation to be processed has length zero.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter length of permutation: <u>8</u><br>
Enter f(1): <u>7</u><br>
Enter f(2): <u>8</u><br>
Enter f(3): <u>5</u><br>
Enter f(4): <u>3</u><br>
Enter f(5): <u>4</u><br>
Enter f(6): <u>6</u><br>
Enter f(7): <u>2</u><br>
Enter f(8): <u>1</u><br>
Cyclic representation is:<br>
&lt;1 7 2 8&gt;<br>
&lt;3 5 4&gt;<br>
&lt;6&gt;<br>
<br>
Enter length of permutation: <u>0</u>

<A NAME="Polynomial_Multiplication">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Polynomial Multiplication</b></A>

<p>
A <b>polynomial</b> is a sum of terms, where each term is a coefficient
multiplied by the variable <em>x</em> raised to some nonnegative integer
power.  The largest such power is referred to as the <b>degree of</b>
the polynomial.  The product of the polynomials
<center>
<em>a<sub>0</sub></em> + <em>a<sub>1</sub>x</em> +
<em>a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></em> + ... +
<em>a<sub>m</sub>x<sup>m</sup></em>  &nbsp; and &nbsp;
<em>b<sub>0</sub></em> + <em>b<sub>1</sub>x</em> +
<em>b<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></em> + ... +
<em>b<sub>n</sub>x<sup>n</sup></em> 
</center>
is the polynomial
<center>
<em>c<sub>0</sub></em> + <em>c<sub>1</sub>x</em> +
<em>c<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup></em> + ... +
<em>c<sub>m+n</sub>x<sup>m+n</sup></em>
</center>
where, for each <em>k</em> from 0 to <em>m+n</em>,
<center>
<em>c<sub>k</sub> = a<sub>0</sub>b<sub>k</sub> +
                    a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>k-1</sub> +
                    a<sub>2</sub>b<sub>k-2</sub> + ... +
                    a<sub>k</sub>b<sub>0</sub> </em>
</center>
<p>
For this to make sense you must assume that <em>a<sub>k</sub> = 0</em>
for <em>k &gt; m</em> and that <em>b<sub>k</sub> = 0</em>
for <em>k &gt; n</em>.
Notice that the sum of the degrees of two polynomials equals the
degree of their product.

<p>
Develop a program that, in the manner illustrated below, takes as input 
the coefficients of two polynomials, each of degree no more than ten,
and outputs their product.  All coefficients will be integers.
Terms in the product having coefficients of zero should not be shown.
As illustrated, use the circumflex character ("^") to indicate exponentiation.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter degree of first polynomial: <u>2</u><br>
Enter coefficient of 0-power term: <u>5</u><br>
Enter coefficient of 1-power term: <u>2</u><br>

<A NAME="Word_Find">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Word Find</b></A>

<p>
In the newspaper, one often runs across a word-find puzzle, which is a grid
of letters through which you search in order to find each word appearing
in a given list.  Each word in the list is "hidden" in the grid so that
it extends either straight to the right, left, up, or down, or along any
of the four diagonal directions.  A word-find is illustrated below, with
the word "computer" hidden in it, shown in boldface.
<p>
<tt>
<b>R</b> T W W I L N B Z C<br>
I <b>E</b> K K L M J E W Q<br>
P Q <b>T</b> S R S F E Q Z<br>

Y M B F E <b>M</b> X S J H<br>
H G E W B Q <b>O</b> S U S<br>
M C V E U I C <b>C</b> P I
</tt>

<p>
Develop a program that takes as input a grid, as illustrated below.
You may assume that the grid will have no more than ten rows and no more
than ten columns.
Once the grid has been input by the user, the program should
ask the user to enter a word.  If the word occurs at least one time in 
the grid, the program should report the beginning and ending locations of 
one such occurrence.  If the word fails to occur in the grid, the program
should report that fact.  The program should continue searching for
words until the user enters the empty string.

In the sample execution below, the input grid is
