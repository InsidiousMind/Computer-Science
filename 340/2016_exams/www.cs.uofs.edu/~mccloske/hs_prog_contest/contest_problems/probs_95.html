<b>Problem 1: Pool pH Maintenance</b></A>
<p>
In order to maintain a pool properly, it is necessary to keep the pH level
as close to 7.4&nbsp;as possible.  Every morning, the pool owner should
check the pH level, and he/she should add, as necessary, either "pH Plus"
or "pH Minus" (which come in the form of measurable powders).  (If the
level is already equal to 7.4 then no pH adjusters should be added.)
One ounce of the "pH&nbsp;Minus" that we are using will decrease the pool's
pH by .1 per 5,000&nbsp;gallons of water.  One ounce of our "pH Plus" will
increase the pool's pH by .2 per 5,000 gallons of water.

<P>
Develop a program that will determine the amount and type of pH adjuster that
should be added to a pool, based on the current pH level and the size of the
pool.  It may be helpful to know that there are 
7.48&nbsp;gallons per cubic&nbsp;foot.

<P>The program should accept input and provide output in the format
shown below, repeating until a "Pool length" value of 0 (zero) is given.
You may assume that the value entered by the user for "Current PH level"
will not be 7.4.

<p><b>Sample Program Execution:</b>
<p>
<tt>
Pool length (feet): <u>24.0</u><br />
Pool width (feet):  <u>12.5</u><br />
Average pool depth (feet): <u>5.25</u><br />
Current pH level: <u>7.2</u><br />
<br />
Pool size is 11781.00 gallons.<br />
Add 2.36 ounces of pH Plus.<br />

<b>Problem 2: Builder's Friend</b></A>

<p>
A wall facing company needs a program to estimate how many bricks--and
pallets of bricks--are needed to face a wall so that they can make more
accurate bids and save money.  The company uses bricks of only one size:
8&nbsp;inches long, 2&nbsp;inches high.  The bricks come on pallets 
of&nbsp;384.  Workers place a half inch of grout between adjacent bricks.
In order to add strength to the wall, it is required that <b>every other</b>
row of bricks begins with a half brick (4 inches wide).
(See illustration for an example.)</P>

<P>
Develop a program that takes as input the length and height of up to six wall
sections and that produces as output the number of bricks and pallets of 
bricks that are needed for the job.  For our purposes, each section of
wall should be considered separate from the others.  Also, all cut scraps
will be thrown out.  In some cases this may be wasteful, but it saves the
builders time.

<P>
The program should accept input and provide output in the format shown
below (repeating until a value of 0 (zero) is entered for the number of
wall sections).

<p>
<b>Sample Program Exeuction:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Number of wall sections: <u>2</u><br />
<br />
Length of section 1 (inches): <u>24</u><br />
Height of section 1 (inches): <u>24</u><br />
Length of section 2 (inches): <u>1200</u><br />
Height of section 2 (inches): <u>24</u><br />
<br />
The number of bricks needed for this job is 1455.<br />
The number of pallets needed for this job is 4.<br />
<br />
<br />
Number of wall sections: <u>0</u>

<A NAME="Sum_Lengths">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Summing Up Lengths</b></A>
<p>
An expression of the form <I>P</I> <B>Yards</B>, <I>Q</I> <B>Feet</B>, 
<I>R</I> <B>Inches</B> is said to be in <I>normal form</I> if 
P&gt;0, 0&lt;Q&lt;3, and 0&lt;R&lt;12.
For example, each of the following is in normal form:
<P>
<center>
  7 Yards, 2 Feet, 11 Inches<br />
  1 Feet, 8 Inches<br />
  2 Yards, 9 Inches<br />
  2 Feet<br />
</center>

<p>
Notice how we omit mention of any unit of measure that is not needed 
(because the corresponding number of units is zero).
In the last expression above, for instance, we mention neither Yards nor
Inches.

<p>
In contrast to the above, none of the following expressions is in normal
form, the first because the number of Feet exceeds 3, the second because 
the number of Inches exceeds 12, and the third because Yards is mentioned
when it need not be.</P>
<P>
<center>
  5 Yards, 4 Feet, 3 Inches<br />
  2 Feet, 15 Inches<br />
  0 Yards, 2 Feet, 7 Inches<br />
</center>

<P>
You are to construct a program that takes as input a sequence of lengths and
produces as output the sum of those lengths, expressed in normal form.
Each input length is entered on a separate line in the form of three integers,
representing a number of yards, feet, and inches, respectively.  (The only
restriction on the inputs is that they be nonnegative.  In particular,
this means that the lengths given as input <em>need not</em> be in 
normal form.)  End of input is signaled by a length of zero.</P>

<P>The program should accept input and provide output in the format shown
below.</P>

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter Length: <u>7 0 4</u><br />
Enter Length: <u>0 5 25</u><br />
Enter Length: <u>2 2 5</u><br />
Enter Length: <u>0 0 0</u><br />
<br />
The sum of the lengths is 12 Yards, 10 Inches

<A NAME="Reverse_Polish">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Reverse Polish Notation</b></A>

<P>
Early in this century, the Polish logician Jan Lucasiewicz introduced a
notation for logical and mathematical expression that eliminated the need
for parentheses and rules of operator precedence and operator associativity
for evaluation of such expressions.  This so-called <em>Polish Notation</em>
calls for the operators to precede their operands.
<!--   Polish Notation is often called "Prefix Notation." -->
A variation, called <em>Reverse Polish Notation</em>,
<!-- or "Postfix Notation," -->
calls for the operators to follow their operands.
For example, to evaluate the (normal) arithmetic expression </P>

<center>8 - 5 + 3</center>

<P>the evaluator would need to know which rules of precedence and
associativity were in force.</P>

<P>In order to indicate explicitly an expression's structure (which
determines how it may be evaluated),
we place parentheses around its subexpressions.
<!--  of an expression in order to indicate explicitly how it is to be
     evaluated.  -->
The expression given above has two possible structures, which are given
below together with how they would be written in Reverse Polish Notation.

<P>
<center>
  (8 - 5) + 3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;85-3+<br />
  8 - (5 + 3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;853+-<br />
</center>

<P>Construct a program that will accept as input a properly formed 
Reverse Polish expression, evaluate it, and report the result. 
Only positive, single digit numbers will be used in the expression, 
although the result may be negative and/or have more than one digit.
Only the operators +, -, *, and / will be used.  
(The "/" operator denotes integer division.)&nbsp;
No spaces or other punctuation will be used, and all input can be assumed
to be valid.</P>

<P>
The program should accept input and provide output in the format shown
below, repeating until a value of 0 (zero) is entered for an expression.</p>

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Reverse Polish Expression: <u>85-3</u><br />
Result: 6 <br />
<br />
Reverse Polish Expression: <u>853+-</u><br />
Result: 0 <br />
<br />
Reverse Polish Expression: <u>72/38+*</u><br />
Result: 33 <br />

Reverse Polish Expression: <u>2</u><br />
Result: 2 <br />
<br />

<p>&nbsp;
<A NAME="Message_Decoder">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Message Decoder</b></A>
<p>
Develop a program that accepts as input two strings, the first of which
is ciphertext (i.e., an encoded message) and the second of which is a 
<em>key</em> that can be used to decode it, and that produces as output 
the <em>plaintext</em> (i.e., the original message).

<p>
The key is a string of four uppercase letters.
To decode the first letter of ciphertext, "add" it (see explanation below) 
to the first letter of the key.  
Similarly, to decode the second, third, and fourth letters of ciphertext,
"add" them to the second, third, and fourth, respectively, letters of the key.  
Beginning with the fifth letter of ciphertext, use the four letters of the
key once more, in the same way.  (Thus, the first letter of the key is used
for decoding the 1st, 5th, 9th, etc., letters of ciphertext, the second
letter of the key is used for decoding the 2nd, 6th, 10th, etc., letters
of ciphertext, and similarly for the third and fourth letters of the key.)
<p>
To "add" two letters together, add their numeric values together
(using A=1, B=2, C=3, ..., Z=26), subtract 26 if the result is greater
than 26, and then find the letter having the corresponding numeric value.
For example, E&nbsp;+&nbsp;C&nbsp;=&nbsp;H (corresponding to 
5&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;8) and 
E&nbsp;+&nbsp;X&nbsp;=&nbsp;C (corresponding to 
5&nbsp;+&nbsp;24&nbsp;-&nbsp;26&nbsp;=&nbsp;3).

<P>Ciphertext given as input will not include lower case letters.
It may, however, include spaces and punctuation marks (e.g., periods,
commas, etc.).
Upper case letters are to be decoded as described above.  Any other
characters are assumed to be their own codes.  (E.g., The result of
decoding a comma is a comma.)  

<P>The program should accept input and provide output in the format shown
below, repeating until a null string is entered for a message.</P>

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter Ciphertext: <u>EN UC ENDVCQG!</u><br />

<A NAME="Max_Segment_Sum">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Maximum Segment Sum</b></A>

<p>
Develop a program that accepts as input a sequence of integers 
and that produces as output the maximum among the sums of 
all the nonempty contiguous subsequences of that sequence.

<P>Consider, for example, the sequence
<p>
<center>
<b>S</b> = &lt;2, 5, -1, -7, 12, 5, 3, -10, 5, -5, 20, -5, 0, 3&gt;
</center>
<p>
<b>S</b> has length 14.  Thus, for every <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> 
satisfying 1 &lt;= <em>i</em> &lt;= <em>j</em> &lt;= 14, there is
a nonempty contiguous subsequence <b>S<sub><em>i</em>.. <em>j</em></sub></b>
beginning with the <em>i</em>-th element of <b>S</b> and ending with
the <em>j</em>-th element of <b>S</b>.
For example, <b>S<sub>3..9</sub></b>&nbsp;= 
&lt;-1,&nbsp;-7,&nbsp;12,&nbsp;5,&nbsp;3,&nbsp;-10,&nbsp;5&gt;.
The sum of the elements in <b>S<sub>3..9</sub></b> is 7.
Some nonempty contiguous subsequences of <b>S</b> have smaller sums
and others have larger sums.  Your program is to find the sum 
that is largest.
<!-- of the nonempty contiguous subsequence whose sum is largest. -->
For <b>S</b>, the answer is 30, because the sum of the elements in 
<b>S<sub>5..12</sub></b> is 30 (12 + 5 + 3 + -10 + 5 + -5 + 20)
and no other nonempty contiguous subsequence of <b>S</b> has a larger sum.
Thus, if your program were given <b>S</b> as input, its output
should be 30. 

<P>
Your program should accept input and provide output in the format shown
below, repeating until the user enters zero as the length of the sequence
to be analyzed.  You may assume that no sequence of length more than 50
will be given as input.

<p>
<b>Sample Program Execution:</b>

<p>
<tt>
Enter length of sequence: <u>14</u><br />
