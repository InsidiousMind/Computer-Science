<b>Problem 1: Continued Fractions</b></A>

<p>
Recall that a rational number is a ratio of two integers.  Typically, we
express a rational number in the form n/d (i.e., as a fraction),
where n and d are integers, with d &gt; 0.  We refer to n and d 
as the <em>numerator</em> and <em>denominator</em>, respectively.

<p>
Interestingly, every positive rational number (by which we mean a
rational number greater than zero) can be expressed in the form
<br><br>
<center>q + 1/E</center>
<!-- <centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
   <Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
   q + \frac1E</td></Table>
   </td></table></centEr>
-->
<br><br>
where q is a nonnegative integer and E is either the number 1 or an
expression of the same form as above.
We call such an expression a <em>continued fraction</em>.

<p>
For example, the rational number 239/51 <!-- \frac23951 -->
is equal to the continued fraction

<pre>
                            1
               4 + -------------------
                              1
                   1 + ---------------
                                1
                       2 + -----------
                                  1
                           5 + -------
                                    1
                               2 + ---
                                    1 </pre>
<!--
  <centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
  <Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
   4 + \frac1 1 +  \frac1 2 + \frac1 5 + \frac1 2 + \frac11 </td></Table>
  </td></table></centEr>
-->


<p>
To describe a continued fraction in a more compact form, we can simply 
write the sequence of nonnegative integers preceding the plus signs,
from top to bottom.  For the above example, this yields the sequence
&lt; 4&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;5&nbsp;2 &gt;.

<p>
For every positive rational number r, there are many (in fact,
infinitely many!) different continued fractions equal to r.
For example, 239 / 51 is equal not only to the continued fraction
corresponding to the sequence
&lt; 4&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;5&nbsp;2 &gt; (as noted above)
but also to the one corresponding to the sequence
&lt; 4&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;5&nbsp;2 &gt; 
(as well as infinitely many others).

<p>
Let us restrict attention to continued fractions corresponding to sequences
in which zero may not appear, except in the first position.
We refer to these as <em>proper</em> continued fractions.
(For example, the continued fraction corresponding to 
&lt; 4&nbsp;1&nbsp;2&nbsp;5&nbsp;2 &gt; is proper, but the one
corresponding to
&lt; 4&nbsp;1&nbsp;1&nbsp;0&nbsp;1&nbsp;5&nbsp;2 &gt;
 is not.)
It turns out that, for every positive rational number r,
there is exactly one proper continued fraction equal to r.

<p>
Develop a program that, given a positive rational number
as input, produces as output the sequence corresponding to the
proper continued fraction to which it is equal.

<p>
<b>Hint:</b> 
Let n and d be positive integers, so that n/d is a positive rational
number.
Divide d into n, letting q be the quotient and r be the remainder.
(That is, let q and r be such that n = qd &nbsp;+ &nbsp;r, 
with 0 &le; r &lt; d.)  
If r = 0, we have

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
n/d &nbsp; =  &nbsp;q &nbsp; =  &nbsp;(q-1) + 1/1</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>

<p>
and thus n/d is equal to the continued fraction corresponding to the
one-element sequence &lt; q-1 &gt;. 
If, on the other hand, r &gt; 0, then 

<p>
<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
n/d &nbsp; =  &nbsp;q + r/d &nbsp; =  &nbsp;q + 1/(d/r)</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>

<p>
and thus the sequence corresponding to the proper continued fraction equal
to n/d is the one obtained by inserting q at the beginning of the 
sequence corresponding to the proper continued fraction equal to d/r.

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer m indicating how
many rational numbers are to be processed.  Each of the next m lines 
contains a pair of positive integers (separated by a space),
the first being the numerator of a rational number and the second being
the denominator.

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
<br>
<p>
For each rational number given as input, the output should include the
sequence corresponding to the unique proper continued fraction equal to
that number.  Each such sequence should appear on a separate line, with 
adjacent elements separated by at least one space.

<p>

<A NAME="Robot_Rendezvous">
<hr>
<b>Problem 2: Robot Rendezvous</b></A>

<p>
Imagine a room in which there are n designated "locations", numbered
1 to n.
Two robots, R2 and D2, are placed into the room, possibly at different
locations.  The robots are programmed so that, whenever a gong is sounded,
they simultaneously move to a specified "next" location, according to a
given "map".
A map indicates, for each location, which location should be visited next.
Thus, a map can be viewed as a function f such that, for each integer i
satisfying 1 &le; i &le; n, if a robot is at location i, then, upon
hearing a gong, it will move to location f(i).

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input the number of locations in the
room, the initial locations of R2 and D2, and the (common) map that they
have been programmed to follow, determines whether the two robots will ever
meet (i.e., be at the same location at the same time), and, if so, the
location and time (i.e., after how many gong soundings) of their first
meeting.
If the robots will <em>never</em> meet, that fact should be reported by the
program.

<p>
<b>Hint:</b>
Developing a program that simulates the movements of the two robots
is a good approach.  However, a program that performs such
a simulation, stopping only when the robots meet, is not a correct
solution, because it gets trapped in an infinite loop in the case that
the robots never meet.

<p>
<b>Input</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line of input contains a positive integer m indicating how
many instances of the problem are to be solved.  The next 3m lines
contain the m instances, three lines per instance.  The three lines
comprising each instance are as follows:  The first line contains a
positive integer n indicating the number of locations in the room.
(You may assume that n &le; 100.)
The second line contains two positive integers (in the range 1 to n)
that indicate the initial locations of R2 and D2, respectively.
The third line contains a sequence of n positive integers, each in the
range 1 to n, representing the map.
For each i satisfying 1 &le; i &le; n, the i-th number in the sequence
indicates the location that is to be visited immediately after location i.
(Viewing the map as a function f, the i-th number in the sequence gives
the value f(i).)

<p>
<b>Output</b>
<br>
<p>
For each instance given as input, the output should include a line that
says either "Robots never meet" or 
"Robots meet at location p after t moves",
where p and t are filled in correctly.
In particular, p and t should describe the location and time
(i.e., number of moves preceding) the robots' <em>first</em> meeting.

<A NAME="Prog_Contest_Scoreboard">
<hr>
<b>Problem 3: Programming Contest Scoreboard</b></A>

<p>
Imagine a computer programming contest that works as follows.
A number of programming problems is posed to each of several competing
teams, and each team tries to solve as many of the problems as it can.
Each time a team has developed what they believe to be a correct solution
to one of the problems, they submit it to the judge.  The judge then
determines, by subjecting the submitted program to a rigorous testing
process, whether or not it is a correct solution.  The team is notified
of the judge's verdict.
In the case that the judge deemed the submission to be incorrect,
the team is free to modify their program and to submit it again.

<p>
Teams are ranked according to the number of problems solved.
In order to break ties among teams that solved the same number
of problems, the amount of time that they used in developing their
solutions is taken into consideration.  Specifically, when a team is
given credit for having solved a particular problem, the time charged
against the team is equal to the number of minutes that had elapsed
(since the contest began) when the correct program was submitted,
plus twenty (20) minutes for each prior submission of an incorrect program
for that problem.  For example, if a team submits a correct solution
to a particular problem 137 minutes into the contest after having twice
submitted incorrect programs for that problem, 137 + 20 + 20 (i.e., 177)
minutes are charged against the team.  Note that no time is charged
against a team for a problem that it never solved, regardless of
how many submissions it may have made for that problem.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input a log of all
program submissions and that produces as output a "scoreboard"
listing the teams in order of their ranks.  Details follow.

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line contains three nonnegative integers, k, m, and n, where
k is the number of competing teams, m is the number of problems posed,
and n is the number of submissions made during the contest.
The teams are numbered from 1 to k and the problems are numbered 
from 1 to m.
You may assume that 0 &lt; k &le; 20 and 0 &lt; m &le; 6.
There is no <em>a priori</em> upper bound upon n, however.

<p>
Each of the next n lines of input represents a program submission
(including the judge's verdict) and consists of four integers:

<DL compact>
<p>
  <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd> <b>(1)</b> a team number (a positive integer between 1 and k),
  <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd> <b>(2)</b> a problem number (a positive integer between 1 and m),
  <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd> <b>(3)</b> a time stamp (a nonnegative integer equal to the number 
            of minutes that had elapsed between the time that the contest
            began and the time that the submission occurred), and
  <dt><b></b></dt>
	<dd> <b>(4)</b> a verdict (0 for incorrect, 1 for correct).
</DL>
<p>
You may assume that the time stamps of the submissions are in nondecreasing
order.  That is, the time stamp in a submission can be no greater than
the time stamp in any submission following it.
You may also assume that, once a team has submitted a correct solution for
a particular problem, it will never make another submission for that problem. 

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line should contain column headings for rank, team number, 
number of problems solved, and time charged.
The second line should contain a horizontal line (comprised of dashes).
The next k lines should include one line for each team, indicating
its rank, team number, number of problems solved, and the time charged
against it.  The teams are to be listed in order according to their ranks.
Two (or more) teams that are tied may be ranked in any order, relative
to one another.  (Notice teams 4 and 5 in the sample output below.)

<A NAME="Digit_Necklaces">
<hr>
<b>Problem 4: Digit Necklaces</b></A>

<p>
Consider the sequence of digits that begins with two specified digits,
d<sub>0</sub> and d<sub>1</sub>, and continues as follows: 
for i<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
>1, let d<sub>i</sub> = (d<sub>i-2</sub> + d<sub>i-1</sub>) &nbsp;mod&nbsp; 10.
(That is, to obtain the i-th digit in the sequence, for i <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> 1,
we take the ones digit of the sum of the (i-1)-st and (i-2)-nd.

<p>
Interestingly, no matter which digits we choose for d<sub>0</sub> and d<sub>1</sub>, it
will always happen that, for some j <font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> 0, d<sub>0</sub> = d<sub>j</sub> and d<sub>1</sub> = d<sub>j+1</sub>.
That is, the sequence is guaranteed to cycle back around to its first two
digits.

<p>
For example, if we choose d<sub>0</sub> = 7 and d<sub>1</sub> = 1,
we get the sequence

<centEr><table border=0 align=center><tr><td>
<Table align=left><tr><td nowrap align=center>
&lt; 7&nbsp;1&nbsp;8&nbsp;9&nbsp;7&nbsp;6&nbsp;3&nbsp;9&nbsp;2&nbsp;1&nbsp;3&nbsp;4&nbsp;7&nbsp;1 &gt;</td></Table>
</td></table></centEr>


Because twelve distinct pairs of adjacent digits occur in the sequence
before it cycles back to its first two digits, 7 and 1, we say that the
pair of digits (7,1) has period 12.  (Of course, every other pair of
adjacent digits occurring in the above sequence has period 12, too.)

<p>
Develop a program that, given as input a pair of digits, reports its period.

<p>
<b>Input:</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line contains a positive integer n indicating the number of
pairs of digits that are to be processed.  Each of the next n lines
contains a pair of digits, separated by a space.

<p>
<b>Output:</b>
<br>
<p>
For each of the n pairs of digits given as input, there should be a
line of output indicating its period.

<A NAME="Text_Formatting">
<hr>
<b>Problem 5: Text Formatting</b></A>

<p>
In ancient times, before the widespread availability of application
software for word processing on PC's (e.g., Microsoft Word,
Corel WordPerfect), there existed less sophisticated software packages
(available mostly for mainframe computers) known as text formatters.
A text formatter takes as input a file containing text (i.e., a sequence
of characters, typically representing a term paper, a memorandum, or some
such document) and produces as output a file containing the same text,
more or less, but formatted in a way specified by the user.
Commonly, the text formatter expected to find embedded within the text
itself the "instructions" describing how it was to be formatted.
(Essentially, web browsers are text formatters that process text
that has been "marked up" with HTML "tags".)

<p>
You are to develop a progam that acts as a very primitive text formatter.
In order to specify the program's intended behavior, it will be useful to
define the term <em>word</em>.  For our purposes, a word is a sequence of
characters that
<br><br>
<p>
<b>(a)</b> contains no spaces (i.e., blanks), and<br>
<b>(b)</b> appears either at the beginning of a line or
             immediately after a space, and<br>
<b>(c)</b> appears either at the end of a line or
             immediately before a space.<br>

<p>
For example, in the line of text<br><br>
<center><tt>was noted, the frog croaked.  But he</tt></center>

<p>
each of &nbsp;"<tt>was</tt>"&nbsp;, &nbsp;"<tt>noted,</tt>"&nbsp;, 
&nbsp;"<tt>the</tt>" &nbsp;, &nbsp;"<tt>frog</tt>"&nbsp, 
&nbsp;"<tt>croaked.</tt>"&nbsp;, &nbsp;"<tt>But</tt>",&nbsp; and 
&nbsp;"<tt>he</tt>"&nbsp; is a word, but neither
&nbsp;"<tt>the frog</tt>"&nbsp; nor &nbsp;"<tt>noted</tt>"&nbsp is a word,
the former because it includes a space and the latter because it
is followed in the text by a non-space (namely, a comma).

<p>
As input, the program will be given a number m representing the desired
width of the text (measured in characters), followed by the text itself.
The text produced as output is to satisfy the following conditions:
<br><br>
<p>
<b>(1)</b> Viewed as a sequence of words, the output must be the
  same as the input.<br>
<b>(2)</b> The number of spaces appearing between adjacent words on a line
   must be exactly one, unless the first of the two words ends with one of
   the characters `.', `!', or `?', in which case the two words must be
   separated by exactly two spaces.<br>
<b>(3)</b> A space may not appear as the first character on a line.<br>
<b>(4)</b> A word may not be split across two lines (i.e., with some of
   it appearing at the end of one line and the rest appearing at the
   beginning of the next line).<br>
<b>(5)</b> Any character beyond the m-th on a line must be a space.
   (Note: This is slightly less strict than to say "No line may be longer
   than m characters in length" because it allows spaces to occur at
   positions m+1, m+2, etc., which may make it slightly easier to
   develop a correct program.)<br>
<b>(6)</b> Every line (except the last one) must contain the maximum
   number of words that will fit on it, while at the same time not
   violating any of the conditions above.  That is, it must not be possible
   to move the first word on a line to the end of the previous line without
   violating any of the conditions above.

<p>
<b>Input</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line contains a positive integer m indicating the desired width
of the output text.  On the lines that follow is the text itself.
You may assume that, with the exception of the end-of-line and end-of-file
"characters", all characters occurring in the text are "printable"
symbols that appear on a typical computer keyboard.
For example, no "control characters" will occur, nor will the tab
character.  You may also assume that m is no less than the length of
the longest word in the text.
(If that weren't true, it would be impossible to produce correct output!)

<p>
<b>Output</b>
<br>
<p>
The text produced as output is to satisfy conditions (1) through (6) listed
above.

<A NAME="Bowling">
<hr>
<b>Problem 6: Let's Go Bowling</b></A>

<p>
In the popular game of bowling, a player throws a heavy ball down a
long, narrow lane at the end of which stand ten wooden pins.
The player's goal is to knock down all ten pins.
If she succeeds in a single attempt, she is said to have made a
<em>strike</em>.  If, after her first attempt, one or more pins are
left standing, she throws the ball again in order to knock down the
remaining pins.  If she succeeds, she is said to have made a <em>spare</em>.
In any case, after throwing two balls (or only one, if it resulted in a
strike), the player is said to have completed a <em>frame</em>.
If pins remain standing after the player has completed a frame, the
frame is said to be <em>open</em>.

<p>
A game of bowling consists of ten frames.  To calculate a player's score
for a game, we award a certain number of 
points for each frame, according to the rules below.
(<b>Note:</b> In standard
bowling terminology, we say <em>pins</em> rather than <em>points</em>,
but here we will use the latter in order to prevent the former from taking
on two different meanings.)

<p>

<OL type="1">  
<li> For an open frame, the number of points awarded is the number of
        pins knocked down in that frame.
  
<li> For a spare, the number of points awarded is ten (10), plus the
        number of pins knocked down on the next ball thrown
        (i.e., the first ball in the next frame).
  
<li> For a strike, the number of points awarded is ten (10), plus the
        number of pins knocked down on the next two balls thrown.
        (If a strike is not thrown in the next frame, these are
        the two balls thrown in the next frame; otherwise, these are
        the first balls thrown in each of the next two frames).
</OL>
<p>
The score for a game is the sum of the points awarded in each of the
ten frames.

<p>
In order to apply the above scoring method to the tenth (i.e., last) frame,
often the player is allowed to throw "extra" balls after completing that
frame.
Specifically, if she makes a spare in the tenth frame, she throws one
more ball. If she makes a strike in the tenth frame, she throws two more balls.

<p>
You are to develop a program that, given as input the number of pins
knocked down by each throw in a game of bowling, calculates the score
achieved by the player.

<p>
<b>Input</b>
<br>
<p>
The first line contains a positive integer n indicating how many
games are to be scored.  The following 2n lines contain the games,
two lines per game.  The first line of each game contains a single
positive integer m indicating the number of throws made during the
game.  The second line contains a sequence of m
nonnegative integers indicating the number of pins knocked down on
each of the throws in that game.
There is nothing in the input to indicate where one frame ends and
another begins.

<p>
You may assume that every game given as input is "valid".
For example, every game described will include ten complete frames
(plus any required extra throws after the tenth frame)
and in no frame will more than ten pins be knocked down.

<p>
<b>Output</b>
<br>
<p>
For each game given as input, the output should show the corresponding
final score, one per line.
