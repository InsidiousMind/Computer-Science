<h2>University of Scranton Annual High School Computer Programming Contest</h2>


<h3>Overview</h3>
</p><p>
The University of Scranton's (U of S) Annual High School Computer
Programming Contest has been held each spring (with one exception) since 1990.
It is sponsored by the U of S's ACM (Association for Computing Machinery)
Student Chapter and by its Department of Computing Sciences.
Historically, most participants have been students attending high schools
in Northeastern Pennsylvania.  
However, on several occasions competitors have come 
from schools more than one hundred miles from Scranton.
<!--as far away as 100+ miles. -->
<!-- However, it has not been unusual to find
     competitors who attend schools from as far away as 100 miles.
-->
Each school is represented by up to three teams, each team having up
to three students.

</p><p>
The competition lasts four hours, during which each team tries to
solve several computer programming problems using
any of a number of programming languages (e.g., Java, C/C++, Python).  
The teams are ranked according to the number of problems they solved
correctly.
Ties are broken according to how much time was needed to solve
the problems, including penalty minutes that are assessed for each
incorrect "solution" submitted.

</p><p>
Following the contest, an awards banquet is held, with
<!-- all participants receive certificates of participation and at which -->
the three highest-ranked teams receiving plaques.
Members of the winning team become eligible to receive 
<!-- In 2002, for the first time, each member of the winning team became
     eligible for
-->
a $500 scholarship to attend the University.

of the 2017 contest</A>, which was held on Friday, April 21.

<h3>Past Contest Problems:</h3>

Below are links to descriptions of the problem sets of past contests,
by year.
<!--
The HTML versions are better viewed using MS Internet Explorer than 
Netscape Navigator, because some mathematical symbols are expressed
in a way that the latter does not display as intended.  As for the
PDF versions, when they are displayed using Adobe Acrobat Reader
some of the characters within the sample input/output appear
to have had their bottom halves chopped off.  To fix this, adjust
the Zoom setting upward or downward.  This affects only the characters
currently on the screen, however.  There appears to be no problem with
the printed version.
<p>
-->
The problems described here are, in essence, the same
as those assigned at the contests.
However, many of the older problems have been rewritten in order
to achieve greater uniformity in style.
We also sought to clarify the problem statements wherever we
perceived that ambiguities might exist.
<!--  These do not represent an exact record of the problems
    actually assigned at the contests.  
-->
<!-- However, some are different in relatively minor ways. -->
