<h2>SE 500 (Math. for SE)<br />
Fall 2017<br />
HW # 4: Additional Proof Techniques<br />
Due: 6pm, Friday, September 29
</h2>

</p><p>
All theorem and exercise numbers refer to the text by Gries and Schneider.
In proving a numbered theorem, you may make use of any lower-numbered
theorem or metatheorem.  (Note that, for example, 3.76a is taken to be
a "lower number" than 3.76e.)

</p><p>
Be careful to respect rules of precedence, in particular that &equiv;
has lower precedence than both &rArr; and &lArr;, each of which has 
lower precedence than both &and; and &or;.

<b>1.</b> Prove
</p><p><center><tt>
 (3.76e) p &and; q &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp; p &and; (q &or; r)
</tt></center>
</p><p>
in five different ways:

</p><p>
<b>(a)</b> Prove it using the method of Section 4.1.  
That is, either transform the antecedant into the consequent or vice versa.
(The consequent has "more structure", so it may be better to start with it.)  
If you transform antecedant into consequent, then in each step the
relationship between the two relevant expressions expressions 
must be either <tt>&equiv;</tt> or <tt>&rArr;</tt> (implies). 
If you go in the opposite direction, the relationship in each step 
must be either <tt>&equiv;</tt> or <tt>&lArr;</tt> 
(is consequence of)).
</p><p>
<b>(b)</b> Prove it using the method of <em>assuming the antecedant</em>.
</p><p>
<b>(c)</b> Prove it using the method of <em>proof by case analysis</em>.
Use <tt>q</tt> and <tt>&not;q</tt> as the two cases.
</p><p>
<b>(d)</b> Prove it using the method of <em>proof by contradiction</em>.
(To prove <tt>A</tt> by contradiction, show <tt>&not;A &rArr; false</tt>.)
</p><p>
<b>(e)</b> Prove it using the method of <em>proof by contrapositive</em>.
(To prove <tt>A &rArr; B</tt> by contrapositive, 
show <tt>&not;B &rArr; &not;A</tt>.)

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>2.</b> Do Exercise 4.2: Prove the monotonicity of &and; (4.3),
</p><p><center><tt>
  (p &rArr; q) &rArr; (p &and; r &rArr; q &and; r)
</tt></center>
</p><p>
using the method of Section 4.1.
It is recommended that you transform the consequent
(which has "more structure") into the antecedant.
Heed the advice from part (a) of the previous problem
regarding the relationships between consecutive expressions.

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>3.</b> (Based on Exercises 4.4 and 4.9)
Prove
</p><p><center><tt>
  (p &rArr; q) &and; (r &rArr; s) &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;
   (p &or; r &rArr; q &or; s)
</tt></center>
in three different ways.
</p><p>
<b>(a)</b> Prove it using the method of Section 4.1.
Here, it is recommended that you transform the antecedant into the
consequent. 
Once again, heed the advice in part (a) of Problem 1.
<!--  Of course, a valid proof of this form must be such that,
   for any two expressions on successive lines, the relationship between
   the first and second is either <tt>&equiv;</tt> or <tt>&rArr;</tt>.
-->
</p><p>
It is suggested that you use (not necessarily in this order): 
(3.59) (twice), (3.46) (three times), 
(3.76d) twice (once to "get rid of" an occurrence of <tt>&not;p</tt>
and once to get rid of an occurrence of <tt>&not;r</tt>),
an absorption theorem (to get rid of an occurrence of <tt>q</tt>),
and DeMorgan (twice).

</p><p>
<b>(b)</b> Prove it by the method of <em>assuming the antecedant</em>.
Note that, because the consequent is itself an implication, you can prove
it, if you wish, by assuming the antecedant of the consequent.
Do not use (4.2) (Monotonicity of <tt>&or;</tt>) in your proof.
Also note that, when you make an assumption, you are,
in effect, assuming anything that is equivalent to (or even implied by)
your assumption.  Hence, for example, by assuming <tt>p &rArr; q</tt>,
you are also assuming, by (3.60), <tt>p &and; q &equiv; p</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>(c)</b> Prove it, making use of (4.2). 

<!-- Remnant from 2011?  This HW is long enough without it!
<hr>
</p><p>
<b>6.</b> (Based on Exercise 4.10)
Prove Modus ponens (3.77)
</p><p><center><tt>p &and; (p &rArr; q) &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp; q</tt></center>
in three different ways.
</p><p>
<b>(a)</b> Use <em>proof by contradiction</em>.
  (It's recommended that you use an absorption theorem along the way.)
</p><p>
<b>(b)</b> Use <em>proof by contrapositive</em>.
</p><p>
<b>(c)</b> Use <em>proof by case analysis</em>.
