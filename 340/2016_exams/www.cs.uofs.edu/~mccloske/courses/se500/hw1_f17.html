<h2>
SE 500 (Math for SE) &nbsp; Fall 2017 <br />
HW #1: Textual Substitution, Inference Systems, Boolean Functions
and Expressions
 <br />
Due: 7:20pm, Monday, Aug. 28
</h2>

</p><p>
The exercises referred to by number come from
the Gries &amp; Schneider textbook.
Exercises from Chapter 1 are found on
<a href="gries_schneider_pp21-23.pdf">page 21</a>
and those from Chapter 2 are found on
<a href="gries_schneider_pp38-39.pdf">pages 38-39</a>.

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Do Exercise 1.2, parts (b) through (f).
   The answer to (a) is  <b>b+2</b>.  Don't forget that textual substitution
   has higher precedence than any other operator.

</p><p>
<b>2.</b> Do Exercise 1.3, parts (b) through (f).
   The answer to (a) is  <b>y*x + 2</b> .


</p><p>
<b>3.</b> Let F be the formal system whose set of <b>well-formed formulas</b>
(wff's) includes precisely those strings of the form 
x&Delta;y&Delta;z,
where each of x, y, and z is a string composed of
<tt>&lowast;</tt>'s and whose axioms and inference rules are as follows:


<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="8">
<tr>
  <th>Axiom</th>
  <th>R<sub>1</sub></th>
  <th>R<sub>2</sub></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><center>&Delta;&Delta;</center></td>
  <td><center>u<tt></tt>&Delta;v&Delta;w<tt>&lowast;</tt></center>
      <hr>
      <center>u&Delta;v<tt>&lowast;</tt>&Delta;w</center>
  </td>
  <td><center>u&Delta;v&Delta;w</center>
      <hr>
      <center><tt>&lowast;</tt>u&Delta;v&Delta;w<tt>&lowast;</tt></center>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>



</p><p>
A wff is, in other words, a string of <tt>&lowast;</tt>'s with two
&Delta;'s thrown in, and the wff that includes no
<tt>&lowast;</tt>'s is accepted, without proof, as a theorem.

</p><p>
Rule 1 says, in effect, that if, in a theorem, we transfer one
<tt>&lowast;</tt> from the end to the region lying between the two 
&Delta;'s, what we get is another theorem.

</p><p>
Rule 2 says, in effect, that if, in a theorem, we insert one
<tt>&lowast;</tt> at the beginning and another at the end,
what we get is another theorem.

</p><p>
As an example, here is a proof of 
<tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt>:

<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
  <th>(1)</th>
  <td>&Delta;&Delta;</td>
  <td>(axiom)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>(2)</th>
  <td><tt>&lowast;</tt>&Delta;&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt></td>
  <td>R<sub>2</sub>, with u,v,w := &lambda;, &lambda;, &lambda; applied to (1)
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>(3)</th>
  <td><tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>&Delta;&Delta;<tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt></td>
  <td>R<sub>2</sub>, with u,v,w := <tt>&lowast;</tt>, &lambda; ,<tt>&lowast;</tt> 
      applied to (2)
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>(4)</th>
  <td><tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt>
  </td>
  <td>R<sub>1</sub>, with u,v,w := <tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>, &lambda;, <tt>&lowast;</tt>
      applied to (3)
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

</p><p>
Note that &lambda; refers to the empty string.

</p><p>
<b>(a)</b>
Show a proof of 
<tt>&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;&lowast;</tt>

</p><p>
<b>(b)</b>
Argue for the following claim:
<blockquote>
  If k &ge; m &ge; 0, then 
  <!-- For every k,m satisfying k &ge; m &ge; 0,  -->
  <tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>m</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k-m</sup>
  is a theorem.
</blockquote>
By <tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>r</sup> we mean a string of <tt>&lowast;</tt>'s
of length r.

</p><p>
<b>Suggested Approach:</b> Provide informal instructions for writing a
proof of 
<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>m</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k-m</sup>
for arbitrarily chosen values of k and m that satisfy k &ge; m &ge; 0.

</p><p>
<b>(c)</b>
Argue for the following claim:
<blockquote>
  If <tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>m</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>n</sup>
  is a theorem, then k-m = n.
  <!-- If k, m, and n are natural numbers such that k-m &ne; n, then -->
  <!--For every k,m,n &ge; 0 such that k-m &ne; n, -->
  <!--
  <tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>k</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>m</sup>&Delta;<tt>&lowast;</tt><sup>n</sup>
  is <em>not</em> a theorem.
  -->
</blockquote>

</p><p>
<b>Suggested approach:</b> Explain why it must be that every line of
every proof is such that the wff on that line satisfies the stated condition.
For one-line proofs, this is easy.  For multiple-line proofs, you need only
show that the wff on the last line satisfies the stated condition, under
the assumption that the wff's on all previous lines do.

<b>4.</b> Let <tt>f : bool &times; bool &rarr; bool</tt> be
a two-argument boolean function.  We say that <tt>f</tt>
is <b>reflexive</b> if <tt>f(p,p)</tt> is <b>true</b> 
for both possible values of <tt>p</tt> (<b>true</b> and <b>false</b>).
We say that <tt>f</tt> is <b>symmetric</b> if <tt>f(p,q) = f(q,p)</tt>
for all possible combinations of values of
<tt>p</tt> and <tt>q</tt> (of which there are four, of course).

</p><p>
Exactly two among the sixteen two-argument boolean functions
(see the table in Section 2.1) are reflexive but <b>not</b> symmetric.
Identify them.

</p><p>
<b>5.</b> Do Exercise 2.1.

</p><p>
<b>6.</b> Do parts (e) through (h) of Exercise 2.2.

</p><p>
<b>7.</b> Do Exercise 2.5 
  Remember that the first step is to asign 'names' (boolean variables)
  to the atomic sub-propositions (e.g., "It's raining", "I'll eat my hat").

</p><p>
<b>8.</b> Do parts (a) and (b) of Exercise 2.6.
