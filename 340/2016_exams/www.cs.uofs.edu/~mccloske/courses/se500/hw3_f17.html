<h2>
SE 500 (Math for SE) &nbsp; Fall 2017<br />
HW #3: Inequivalence, Disjunction, Conjunction, and Implication<br />
Due: 7:20pm, Monday, September 18
</h2>

All the problems are based on exercises at the end of Chapter 3 of
the Gries &amp; Schneider text.
In proving a theorem, you may make use of only lower-numbered
theorems (or "metatheorems").
Note that some of the exercises may have hints that appear in the book,
but not here.
Don't forget the precedences of operators, which can be found on the
textbook's inside front cover (in the hardback version at least) and
<a href="gries_operator_precedence.html">here</a>.
In exercises involving conjunction, expect to apply the Golden Rule
(3.35) quite frequently and (3.32) occasionally.


</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Do Exercise 3.14, which is to prove mutual interchangability
of <tt>&equiv;</tt> and <tt>&ne;</tt> (3.19):
</p><p><center>(3.19)
 <tt>p &ne; q &equiv; r &nbsp;  &equiv; &nbsp; p &equiv; q &ne; r</tt>
</center>
</p><p>
using the heuristic of Definition elimination(3.23).

<b>2.(a)</b> 
  <!-- Do Exercise 3.15, which is to make a convincing argument that 
       &mdash;assuming <tt>&equiv;</tt>, <tt>&not;</tt>, <em>true</em>,
       and <em>false</em> have their standard meanings as given in 
       Section 2.1&mdash; Axioms (3.24) through (3.28) uniquely determine
       the meaning of <tt>&or;</tt>.
       In other words, the function described in the second column of the table
       on page 26 &mdash;which we refer to as <em>disjunction</em>&mdash; is the
       only function among the sixteen functions having signature
       <b>bool <tt>&times;</tt> bool &rarr; bool</b> that satisfies
       all five of the axioms (3.24) &mdash; (3.28).
  -->
Suppose that you took Axioms (3.24) through (3.28) and replaced
each occurrence of &or; by &oplus;.  
Call the resulting equations (3.24'), (3.25'), ..., (3.28').
(The idea is that &oplus; could stand for any of the sixteen functions 
with signature <b>bool &times; bool &xrarr; bool</b>, as are described 
on page 26 of Gries &amp; Schneider.)
</p><p>
Make a convincing argument that, among those sixteen functions,
the only one that makes all of (3.24'), (3.25'), ..., (3.28')
into tautologies is the one that we call <b>disjunction</b>.
(In other words, show that if we let &oplus; stand for any of the fifteen
functions other than disjunction, at least one among (3.24'), (3.25'), ..., 
(3.28') is not a tautology.)

</p><p>
<b>(b)</b>
Now find a smallest subset of {(3.24'), (3.25'), ..., (3.28')} such that
&oplus; must stand for disjunction in order for all members of that 
subset to be tautologies.
(In effect, you are being asked to identify a smallest set of
axioms, among (3.24), ..., (3.28), that suffice to uniquely
identify disjunction among all sixteen two-argument boolean functions.)
<!-- (Two students claim that a particular set of two of the axioms are
sufficient.)
-->

<hr>
<b>3.</b> Do Exercise 3.18, which is to prove Distributivity of <tt>&or;</tt>
over <tt>&or;</tt>:
</p><p><center><tt>
  (3.31) p &or; (q &or; r) &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; (p &or; q) &or; (p &or; r)
  <!-- (3.31) p v (q v r) = (p v q) v (p v r) -->
</tt></center>

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>4.</b> Without using (3.32), prove 
</p><p><center><tt>p &or; (q &ne; r) &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; 
               p &or; (q &equiv; r) &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; p
</tt></center>
</p><p>
<b>Hint:</b> Use (3.27).

<!--
</p><p>
<hr>
<b>8.</b> Do Exercise 3.22, which is to prove Symmetry of <tt>&and;</tt>:
</p><p><center><tt>
  (3.36) p &and; q &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; q &and; p
  <!-- (3.31) p & q = q & p -->
</tt></center>
-->

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>5.</b> Do Exercise 3.24, which is to prove Zero of <tt>&and;</tt>:
</p><p><center><tt>
  (3.40) p &and; <em>false</em> &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; <em>false</em>
  <!-- (3.31) p & false = false -->
</tt></center>


</p><p>
<hr>
<b>6.</b> Do Exercise 3.29, which is to prove one form of Absorption:
<p><center><tt>
  (3.44b)  p &or; (&not;p &and; q)  &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;  p &or; q
</tt></center>

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>7.</b> Do Exercise 3.33, which is to prove one form of De Morgan:
<p><center><tt>
  (3.47b)  &not;(p &or; q)  &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;  &not;p &and; &not;q
</tt></center>
</p><p>
<b>Hint:</b> Look to use (3.35) at least twice.
Also, look to use either (3.32) or else each of (3.9), (3.11), and (3.47a).

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>8.</b> Do Exercise 3.34, which is to prove
<p><center><tt>
  (p &and; q) &or; (p &and; &not;q)  &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;  p
  <!-- (p & q) v (p & !q) = p -->
</tt></center>

  p &rArr; q &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; &not;p &and; &not;q &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; &not;q
