SE 500 (Math for SE) &nbsp; Fall 2017 <br />
HW #2: Substitution and Leibniz Inference Rules,
       Proofs involving Equivalence and Negation
       <br />
Due:  4pm, Wednesday, Sept. 7
</h2>

</p><p>
<p>
The exercises referred to come from the end of Chapters 1, 2, and 3 in the
Gries & Schneider text (a copy of which will be on reserve in the library).

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Do Exercise 1.6.  Specifically, show two different instantiations
of Inference Rule Substitution (1.1)

</p><p>
<center>
<table>
<tr>
  <td><center>E <hr> E[v:=F]</center>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p><p>
in each case taking <b>E</b> to be the theorem
&nbsp;<tt>x&gt;y &or; x&le;y</tt>&nbsp; 
and <b>v</b> to be the list of variables <tt>x,y</tt>.
(So all that is left for you is to instantiate <b>F</b> in
two different ways.  Make sure that at least one of them
involves compound expressions.)


</p><p>
<b>2.</b> Do Exercise 1.7, parts (b) through (e).
Each answer should show an instantiation of Leibniz, together with a
statement telling to what each of X, Y, E, and z was instantiated 
in order to arrive at it.  For example, the answer to part (a) is

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr><td><center>
<tt>x = x+2<br /><hr>4*x+y = 4*(x+2)+y</tt>
</center></td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<!--
<pre>
                                x = x+2
                           -------------------
                            4*x+y = 4*(x+2)+y  </pre>
-->

</p><p>
at which one arrives by the instantiation <tt>X:x, Y:x+2, E:4*z+y, z:z</tt>. 


</p><p>
<b>3.</b> Do Exercise 1.8, parts (b) through (e).
The solution to (a) is  <b><tt>b+c+y+w</tt></b>.
<br />
(Note: Depending upon which printing of the book you have, you may or may
not have to swap the two sides of X=Y in parts (b) and (e).)

</p><p>
<b>4.</b> Do Exercise 1.9, parts (b) through (e).  The solution to (a) is  
<b><tt>E:(x+y)*z, X:x+y, Y:y+x</tt></b>.


</p><p>
<b>5.</b> In each step in the proof below, <b>Leibniz</b> (with an assist
from <b>Substitution</b>) is applied.  That is, in going from each line
to the next, some subexpression <tt>E</tt> is replaced by an expression
<tt>F</tt> such that <tt>E = F</tt> (or possibly <tt>F = E</tt>) is
an instantiation of (i.e., the conclusion of applying <b>Substitution</b> to)
one of the theorems in our arsenal.
(That is, <tt>E = F</tt> (or else <tt>F = E</tt>) is <tt>P[r:=Q]</tt>,
where <tt>P</tt> is a theorem in our arsenal, <tt>r</tt> is a list of
variables, and <tt>Q</tt> is a list (of length equal to <tt>r</tt>)
of expressions.)

</p><p>
Here, the only theorems used are axioms (3.1), (3.2), and (3.3).
Fill in each "hint" so as to inform the reader which theorem (and which
instantiation of it) was used.  The first hint is filled in for you. 
Also, somehow highlight the subexpressions <tt>E</tt> and <tt>F</tt>
in each step (using underlining or circling or something).
In the first step below, the former is in boldface and the latter 
is in italics.

<pre>
      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; (<b>true</b> &equiv; (q &equiv; r))

   =      < (3.3), with q:=p >

      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; (<em>(p &equiv; p)</em> &equiv; (q &equiv; r))

   =      <                                                 >

      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; (p &equiv; (p &equiv; (q &equiv; r)))

   =      <                                                 >

      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; (p &equiv; ((p &equiv; q) &equiv; r))

   =      <                                                 >

      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; (((p &equiv; q) &equiv; r) &equiv; p)

   =      <                                                 >

      (p &equiv; q) &equiv; ((p &equiv; q) &equiv; (r &equiv; p))

   =      <                                                 >

      ((p &equiv; q) &equiv; (p &equiv; q)) &equiv; (r &equiv; p)

   =      <                                                 >

      true &equiv; (r &equiv; p) 

   =      <                                                 >

      r &equiv; p
</pre>

The remaining problems are based on exercises at the end of Chapter 3 of
the Gries &amp; Schneider text.
In proving a theorem, you may make use of only lower-numbered
theorems (or "metatheorems").
Note that some of the exercises have hints that appear in the book,
but not here.
Don't forget the precedences of operators, which can be found on the
textbook's inside front cover (in the hardback version at least) and
<a href="gries_operator_precedence.html">here</a>.

</p><p>
<b>6.</b> Do Exercise 3.7, which is to prove theorem (3.11) 
(which is <tt>&not;p &equiv; q &equiv; p &equiv; &not;q</tt>)
in three different ways.
Specifically, for each of these, transform the left-hand side
into the right-hand side (or vice versa): 
<ul>
  <li><tt>(&not;p &equiv; q) &equiv; (p &equiv; &not;q)</tt></li>
  <li><tt>(&not;p &equiv; p) &equiv; (q &equiv; &not;q)</tt>
      (which is obtained from (3.11) by applying (3.2)</tt>)
  </li>
  <li><tt>&not;p &equiv; (q &equiv; p &equiv; &not;q)</tt></li>
</ul>
<!--
(Based on Exercise 3.7) 
In class we proved
  (3.11)&nbsp; <tt>&not;p &equiv; q &equiv; p &equiv; &not;q</tt> &nbsp;
Here you are asked to do it in a different way, namely by 
transforming <tt>&not;p &equiv; p</tt> into <tt>&not;q &equiv; q</tt>.
</p><p>
Note that this corresponds to proving
<tt>&not;p &equiv; p &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; &not;q &equiv; q</tt>,
which, by an application of (3.2), is equivalent to (3.11).

<b>7.</b> Do Exercise 3.12, which is to prove the associativity of
<tt>&ne;</tt>:
<p><center>(3.17)  <tt>((p &ne; q) &ne; r)  &equiv;  (p &ne; (q &ne; r))</tt>
</center>
<p>
using the heuristic of Definition Elimination (3.23).
(Note that <tt>&ne;</tt> is used here rather than <tt>&equiv;</tt>
with a line through it.  Why?  Because the latter symbol seems not to
exist in HTML.)

<!--
</p><p>
<hr>
<b>8.</b> Do Exercise 3.13, which is to prove mutual associativity
of <tt>&equiv;</tt> and <tt>&ne;</tt> (3.18):
</p><p><center>(3.18)
 <tt>((p &ne; q) &equiv; r)  &equiv;  (p &ne; (q &equiv; r))</tt>
</center>
</p><p>
using the heuristic of Definition elimination(3.23).
