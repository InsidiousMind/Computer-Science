HW #5: Logical Arguments<br />
Due: 5pm, Friday, October 13
</h2>

</p><p>
Consider these three premises/facts
(adapted from Exercise 5.9 of Gries &amp; Schneider):

</p><p>
<ul>
  <!--
  <li>F<sub>0</sub>: If Bill takes the bus, then if the bus is late he
      misses his appointment.
  </li>
  <li>F<sub>1</sub>: If Bill misses his appointment and feels downcast,
      he doesn't go home.
  </li>
  <li>F<sub>2</sub>: If Bill does not get the job, he feels downcast
      and does not go home.
  </li>
  -->
  <li>F<sub>0</sub>: If Bill goes to class, then if the professor is 
      late Bill learns nothing.
  </li>
  <li>F<sub>1</sub>: If Bill learns nothing and feels good,
      he does not go to the store.
  </li>
  <li>F<sub>2</sub>: If Bill does not eat, he feels good 
      and does not go to the store.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
There are six primitive propositions here:
<ul>
  <li>GC: Bill goes to class.</li> <!-- <li>TB: Bill take the bus.</li> -->
  <li>LN: Bill learns nothing.</li> <!-- <li>MA: Bill misses his appointment.</li> -->
  <li>PL: The professor is late.</li> <!-- <li>BL: The bus is late.</li> -->
  <li>GS: Bill goes to the store.</li> <!-- <li>GH: Bill goes home.</li> -->
  <li>FG: Bill feels good.</li> <!-- <li>FD: Bill feels downcast.</li> -->
  <li>BE: Bill eats.</li> <!-- <li>GJ: Bill gets the job.</li> -->
</ul>

<b>1.</b> 
Use the methods from the Gries &amp; Schneider text to show that 
each of the following conclusions follows from the above premises:

</p><p>
<b>(a)</b> If Bill learns nothing and goes to the store, then he eats.
  <!-- If Bill misses his appointment and goes home, then he gets the job.-->
<br />
<b>(b)</b> If the professor is late and Bill feels good and goes to the store,
    then Bill does not go to class.
  <!-- If the bus is late and Bill feels downcast and goes home,
       then Bill doesn't take the bus. -->

</p><p>
Keep in mind that any premise (and the conclusion, for that matter) 
can be rewritten as any boolean expression to which it is equivalent.
(In particular, you might find it helpful to make use of the 
contrapositive of an implication.)

</p><p>
<b>2.</b> 
Do Problem 1 again, but this time using <b>resolution</b>
(in the proof by contradiction mode, as illustrated in class and on 
the relevant web page).

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Using the methods of Gries &amp; Schneider, prove the validity of the
following argument.
  <!-- Argument taken from "Logic, Language, Formalism, Informalism",
     by Daniel Richardson, pp. 75-76 (Problem 5.12)
  -->
<blockquote>
  Louise is lying.  If kangaroos are numerous and Louise is lying,
  then Harriet is lying.  If kangaroos are numerous and the dog got
  outside last night and Harriet is lying, then I am an idiot.
  If the dog got outside last night, then kangaroos are numerous.
  If Louise is lying, then the dog got outside last night.
  Therefore, I am an idiot.
</blockquote>

</p><p>
Don't forget that any boolean expression can be rewritten as any
expression to which it is equivalent.  Also recall that implications
have contrapositives.

</p><p>
<b>4.</b> Do Problem 3 again, but this time using resolution.

</p><p>
<hr>
<hr>
<p>
The remaining problems are with respect to the Island of Knights and Knaves,
each of whose inhabitants is either a knight (who always tells the truth)
or a knave (who always lies).  Among those inhabitants are Bill and Carol.
Use <tt>b</tt> and <tt>c</tt>, respectively, to stand for
the propositions <em>Bill is a knight</em> and <em>Carol is a knight</em>.
For each problem, determine the strongest statement you can make
with respect to which inhabitants mentioned are knights and which
are knaves.  If the problem involves the question of whether or not there
is gold on the island, determine the strongest statement you can make
about the answer to that question.
</p><p>
<!-- If the premises of a problem are inconsistent (which is to say that their
     conjunction implies false), indicate that fact.
-->
If the premise of a problem is equivalent to false, indicate that fact.

</p><p>
In all cases, provide a proof in the Gries &amp; Schneider style and
heed their advice: If Bill utters a proposition that is formalized by
the expression <tt>X</tt>, this gives rise to the premise
<tt>b &equiv; X</tt>, and similarly for Carol.

</p><p>
Theorems that might be useful to you in two of the problems are
</p><p>
<b>(HW5.1)</b> <tt>p &equiv; p&and;q &equiv; &not;p&or;q</tt><br />
<b>(HW5.2)</b> <tt>((p &equiv; q) &rArr; p) &equiv; p&or;q</tt> 

</p><p>
(HW5.1) can be proved in two steps using (3.59) and (3.60).
If you make use of (HW5.2), provide a proof.  In such a proof,
(HW5.1) could be useful.

</p><p>
<b>5.</b> Bill said, "If Carol is a knave, I am a knight."

</p><p>
<b>6.</b> Bill said, "If there is gold on the island, I'm a knave."

</p><p>
<b>7.</b> Bill said, "If I am a knave, there is gold on the island."

</p><p>
<b>8.</b> Bill said, "Among Carol and me, exactly one is a knight."

</p><p>
<b>9.</b> 
Carol said something that we could not hear.  In reply, Bill said, 
"If Carol said that I am a knave, she is a knight."

</p><p>
<b>10.</b> 
Carol said something that we could not hear.  In reply, Bill said, 
"If Carol said that there is gold on the island, I am a knave."
