<h2>Specifying Run Arguments in jGrasp</h2>

</p><p>
A Java class that can serve as an <b>application program</b>
(meaning that you can "run" it) must have a <tt>main()</tt> method.
When the application is run, execution begins in that method,
the heading of which must be as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>public static void main(String[] args)</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
Well, you can change <tt>args</tt> to any legal identifier,
but otherwise the heading must look like this.

</p><p>
What this heading indicates is that <tt>main()</tt> 
receives as a parameter an array of <tt>String</tt> objects.
But how does one, when running a program, "pass" a parameter to it?

</p><p>
In the context of the IDE jGrasp, you would do this:

<ol>
  <li>Make the application program to be run the current class
      (by clicking on the window containing its source code).
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Build</b> (in the Menu Bar) so that the associated
      menu appears.
  </li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Run Arguments</b> box on the menu so that it has a
      checkmark in it.
      (Recall that "parameter" and "argument" are somewhat synonymous.)
      A text box should immediately appear above the application program's
      source code.
  </li>
  <li>Enter into that text box one or more arguments, separated by
      spaces.  Typically, such an argument might be the name of a
      file that you intend for the program to use as input.
      If that file were named <tt>data.txt</tt>, you would enter that
      into the text box (with no quotes).
  </li>
  <li>Click on the Run icon.
  </li>
</ol>
