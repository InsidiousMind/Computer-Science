<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />  <!-- Fall 2016 -->
Preview for Test #2
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Know everything that you were supposed to know for Test #1.</li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Expect a question in which you are given a set of terms having to
    do with Java programming and a list of statements each of which
    has one or two blanks to be filled in from terms in the given set.
    Example:
    <ol>
      <li>A(n) _____ method is one that returns information about the 
          state of a(n) _____.
      </li>
    </ol>
      The answers are <b>observer</b> and <b>object</b>.
    </ol>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Expect a problem in which you are given the code of an "instance" class
      (i.e., one from which it is intended that objects will be created)
      and you are asked to write a code segment that might appear in a
      client program, such as one that creates an object of that class
      (or perhaps two of them) and carries out some specific task with it/them.
      </p><p>
      <b>Example:</b>
      Develop the <tt>main()</tt> method of an application program
      that creates two <tt>TossableCoin</tt> objects and repeatedly tosses 
      both of them until exactly one of them is showing heads.  Then report
      how many tosses were made to reach that situation.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Expect a problem in which a program, or code segment, is given and
    you are asked to show what output it produces.
    (Or a functional method is given, with parameter value(s) specified,
    and you are asked to indicate what value the method returns.)
    Don't be surprised if the code involves the creation and/or manipulation
    of objects (e.g. Strings, an array).  
    Also expect to see if-else statement(s) and/or loop(s).
    If a loop is involved, the problem might ask you to show the values
    of one or more variables at specific moments in time (e.g., at the
    end of each loop iteration).
    </p><p>
    <b>Example 1:</b> Tell what value is returned by the method call
    <tt>mystery(100)</tt>, where the relevant method is as follows:
    </p><p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
    <tr><td>
<pre>public static int mystery(int m)
{
   int low = 0, high = m+1;
   while (low + 1 != high) {
      int mid = (low + high) / 2;
      if (mid * mid <= m) { low = mid; }
      else { high = mid; }
   }
   return low;
}</pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    Also show the values of local variables <tt>low</tt> and <tt>high</tt>
    at the end of each loop iteration.
    </p><p>
    <b>Example 2:</b> Tell what value is returned by the method call
    <tt>stringSwap("abcdefghi")</tt>, where the relevant method is as 
    follows:
    </p><p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
      <tr><td>
<pre>public static int stringSwap(String s)
{
   int k = s.length() / 2;
   return s.substring(k) + s.substring(0,k);
}</pre>
      </td></tr>
    </table>
    </p><p>
    <b>Example 3:</b> Show the contents of array <tt>a[]</tt> upon
    completion of execution of this code segment:
    </p><p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
      <tr><td>
<pre>int[] a = new int[6];
a[0] = 1;
for (int i=1; i != a.length; i=i+1) { a[i] = 2 * a[i-1]; }</pre>
      </tr></td>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li>Expect a problem in which you are given a Java class and are asked
    to modify a method, or add a new method, so that the method behaves
    in a specified way.  Another possibility is to write a method that
    carries out some operation upon a String object (or a pair thereof).
    </p><p>
    <b>Example 1:</b> You are given the <tt>WrapAroundCounter</tt> class
    and are asked to add a new method as follows:
    </p><p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
    <tr><td>
<pre>/* Increments this counter by the specified amount (k), wrapping
** around if appropriate.  For example, if this counter's maximum value
** is 12 and its current value is 8, then incrementing by 7 results in
** its value being 2.
*/
public void increment(int k) { ... }</pre></td></tr>
    </table>
    </p><p>
    <b>Example 2:</b> Supply a body for the following method:
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
    <tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the distance, within the given String (s), between the
** first two occurrences of the given character (ch).  If there are 
** fewer than two occurrences of ch in s, -1 is returned.
*/
public static int distanceBetween(String s, char ch) { ... }</pre>
    </td></tr>
    </table>
  </li>
</ul>
