Preview for Test #1

Among the things that you should know:
<ul>
  <li><b>Java</b> is the programming language that we are using in this
    course as a vehicle to learn about computer programming.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>jGrasp</b> is the "integrated development environment" (IDE)
    that we are using (at least in lectures) to aid us in developing
    and testing Java code.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Among the kinds of errors that can be present in computer programs
    are <b>syntax</b>, <b>logical</b>, and <b>run-time</b>.
    Syntax errors, which are detected by the Java compiler, are analogous
    to errors in English grammar.
    A run-time error occurs when a program's execution is aborted 
    due to an unexpected condition occurring (e.g., invalid input (such as
    a real number or a string of characters when an integer was expected)),
    division by zero).  A logical error is caused by a programmer making
    a mistake that results in a program that, when executed, behaves in 
    a way that was not intended.  For example, the program could produce
    output that is not correct with respect to its input.
    Run-time errors are often the result of an underlying logical error.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Comments appear in programs to provide useful information to human
      readers.
      Among the kinds of information that comments might convey are
      <ul>
        <li>the program's intended behavior/purpose</li>
        <li>the author(s) (i.e., who developed the code)</li>
        <li>the date(s) on which the program was modified</li>
        <li>an explanation of the reasoning that justifies certain 
            code segments being written as they were
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Java has eight <b>primitive data types</b>.  Among them are
    <b><tt>int</tt></b></tt> (for representing integers),
    <b><tt>double</tt></b> (for representing real numbers), 
    <b><tt>boolean</tt></b> (for representing true and false), 
    and <b><tt>char</tt></b> (for representing character values).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>How to evaluate arithmetic and boolean expressions involving
    literals (e.g., <tt>32</tt>, <tt>1.52</tt>, <tt>true</tt>),
    arithmetic operators (<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>,
    <tt>%</tt>), relational operators (<tt>&lt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;=</tt>,
    <tt>&gt;</tt>, <tt>&gt;=</tt>, <tt>==</tt>, <tt>!=</tt>), and
    boolean operators (<tt>!</tt>, <tt>&amp;&amp;</tt>, <tt>||</tt>).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>You should be able to "trace execution" of a Java program 
    involving variable declarations, assignment statements, methods,
    calls to methods (possibly with parameters being passed and/or values
    being returned by the method), 
    and for-loops.  <!-- , and String objects. -->
    For example, you may be given a Java program and asked to show
    what output it would produce if it were executed.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Given a Java program, you should be able to identify pieces of it
    that are examples of the following elements of the Java language:
    <ul>
      <li>key/reserved word (e.g., <tt>class</tt>, <tt>int</tt>,
          <tt>public</tt>)
      </li>
      <li>comment (e.g., <tt>/* This program does nothing. */</tt>)</li>
      <li>assignment statement (e.g., <tt>x = 3.5</tt> or
                                <tt>grossPay = hoursWorked * hourlyWage</tt>)
      </li>
      <li>numeric literal (e.g., <tt>3.5</tt> in line above)</li>
      <li>String literal (e.g., <tt>"Hello, World!"</tt>)</li>
      <li>variable declaration (e.g., <tt>int numHours</tt>)</li>
      <li>method call (e.g., <tt>drawRightTriangle(k+1)</tt>)</li>
      <li>actual parameter/argument (e.g., the <tt>k+1</tt> in line above)</li>
      <li>method heading (e.g., 
          <tt>public static void drawRightTriangle(int size)</tt>)
      </li>
      <li>formal parameter/argument declaration 
          (e.g., <tt>int size</tt> in line above)
      </li>
      <li>class heading (e.g., <tt>public class Stupid</tt>)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Given a simple computational task that can be accomplished using 
    assignment statements, arithmetic or boolean expressions, 
    calls to methods in the java.lang.Math class, 
    <!-- simple String processing, -->
    and possibly a <b>for-loop</b>, you should be able to
    write Java code (perhaps a method body) that performs it.
    Examples: 
    <ul>
      <li>Given a number of inches, express it in terms of feet and inches.</li>
      <li>Print each even integer in the range 4..51.</li>
      <li>Print the sum of the odd integers in the range 0..13.</li>
      <li>Print the sum of the square roots of the integers in the range 0..13.
      </li>
      <li>"Draw" a figure similar to ones drawn by the <tt>DrawFiguresWithLoops</tt>
          application program.
      </li>
      <!--
        <li>Transform a calendar date in MM/DD/YYYY format into YYYY-MM-DD
            format.
        </li>
      -->
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
