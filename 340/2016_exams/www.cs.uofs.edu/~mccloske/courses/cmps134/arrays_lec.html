<h2>Arrays in Java: Some Examples of Program Development
</h2>

<h3>Array Sum</h3>
</p><p>
Suppose that you had a list of numbers and wanted to find the sum.
Assuming that each number was relatively small in magnitude and the
list was relatively short (so that even the sum would be relatively
small in magnitude), one reasonable approach would be to keep in
mind a "sum-so-far", initially zero, and then examine the numbers
in the list one by one, each time adding the "current" number to
the sum-so-far.

</p><p>
For example, suppose that the list were
&lt; 4 12 -6 2 5 -3 &gt;.  Then you would go through a mental
process as described by this table:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>current<br />number</th><th>sum-so-far</th></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>16 (i.e., 4+12)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-6</td><td>10 (i.e., 4+12+-6)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>12 (i.e., 4+12+-6+2)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>17 (i.e., 4+12+-6+2+5)</td></tr>
<tr><td>-3</td><td>14 (i.e., 4+12+-6+2+5+-3)</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The first row shows the initial situation, before examining any
of the numbers in the list.  Each subsequent row shows the number
currently being examined and the result of adding it to the 
"sum-so-far".  Obviously, by the time we have examined the last
number and added it to the sum-so-far, the sum-so-far is equal
to the sum of all the numbers in the list.
(In fact, more generally you can say that, at any given moment,
the sum-so-far value is equal to the sum of the numbers that have
been examined up to that moment.)

</p><p>
We can mimic this process using Java in a straightforward way, as 
expressed in the following method.  The role of the "list of numbers"
is played by the parameter <tt>a[]</tt>, which is an array of values
of type <tt>int</tt>.  (Of course, the same logic would work just as
well with an array of type <tt>double[]</tt>.)

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the sum of the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int sumOf(int[] a)
{
   int sumSoFar = 0;
   // loop invariant: sumSoFar = sum of elements in a[0..i-1]
   for (int i=0; i != a.length; i = i+1)
   {
      sumSoFar = sumSoFar + a[i];
   }
   return sumSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
A more versatile version of the <tt>sumof()</tt> method would allow
a caller to identify a segment of the array to be summed.
(An <b>array segment</b> is simply a contiguous portion of an array.)
In analogy to the <tt>substring()</tt> method of the class
<tt>String</tt>, we identify an array segment by referring
to the location at which it begins and the location immediately
after where it ends.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the sum of the elements in the specified array segment
** (a[low..high-1]).
** Precondition: 0<=low<=high<=a.length
*/
public static int sumOf(int[] a, int low, int high)
{
   int sumSoFar = 0;
   // loop invariant: sumSoFar = sum of elements in a[low..i-1]
   for (int i=<font color="red">low</font>; i != <font color="red">high</font>; i = i+1)
   {
      sumSoFar = sumSoFar + a[i];
   }
   return sumSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<h3>Array Maximum</h3>
</p><p>
Now we turn to a similar problem, that of finding the maximum value
in an array.  Again consider how you might do this "manually" if given
a list of numbers.  As with finding the sum, here you would examine
each number in the list, one by one.  But this time, rather than adding
the current number to the sum-so-far, you would compare it to a
max-so-far value that you were keeping in mind.  If the current value
exceeded that of the max-so-far value, you would replace the latter with
the current number, as now it qualifies as the maximum of the numbers
seen so far.

</p><p>
For example, suppose that the list were
&lt; 4 7 0 2 9 -3 &gt;.  Then you would go through a mental
process as described by this table:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>current<br />number</th><th>max-so-far</th></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>-&infin; (i.e., maximum of {})</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4 (i.e., maximum of {4})</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td>7 (i.e., maximum of {4,7}</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>7 (i.e., maximum of {4,7,0}</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>7 (i.e., maximum of {4,7,0,2}</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>9 (i.e., maximum of {4,7,0,2,9}</td></tr>
<tr><td>-3</td><td>9 (i.e., maximum of {4,7,0,2,9,-3}</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
We chose -&infin; as the initial value of max-so-far because 
it guarantees that any number in the list is larger.
From a mathematician's perspective, the reason why we chose
zero as the initial value of sum-so-far above is because
zero is the identity element of addition.  Similarly,
-&infin; is the identity element of the maximum operation,
so it is the appropriate initial value for max-so-far.
In Java, the closest we can come to -&infin; is
<tt>Integer.MIN_INT</tt>, which is -2<sup>31</sup>, the 
minimum value among all those in the <tt>int</tt> data type.

</p><p>
Using the <tt>sumOf()</tt> method as a template, we modify it in
the rather obvious way to obtain this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the maximum of the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int maxOf(int[] a)
{
   int maxSoFar = Integer.MIN_INT;
   // loop invariant: maxSoFar = maximum of the elements in a[0..i-1]
   for (int i=0; i != a.length; i = i+1)
   {
      if (a[i] > maxSoFar) { maxSoFar = a[i]; }
   }
   return maxSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
To generalize <tt>maxOf()</tt> to return the maximum element in an
array segment, we would follow exactly the same steps as
we did in generalizing <tt>sumOf()</tt> above.  Specifically,
we would replace <tt>0</tt> and <tt>a.length</tt> in the 
for-loop heading by <tt>low</tt> and <tt>high</tt>, respectively.

</p><p>
From a client's point of view, having a method that identifies the
maximum value in an array could be useful.  
More useful, however, would be to have a method that identifies a
<b>location</b> at which an array's maximum value occurs.
After all, if you know where the maximum is located, you can easily
determine its value simply by referring to the array and using the
location of the maximum as the subscript!  That is, if <tt>r</tt>
is a location of array <tt>b</tt> at which <tt>b</tt>'s maximum
occurs, the expression <tt>b[r]</tt> is that maximum value.

</p><p>
So let's develop a new method, <tt>locOfMax()</tt>, that identifies
the lowest-numbered location of an array where the array's maximum value
occurs.  Given that we already have the <tt>maxOf()</tt> method,
perhaps the most obvious solution is this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the lowest-numbered location at which occurs the maximum
** value of the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int locOfMax(int[] a)
{
   int maxVal = maxOf(a);   // determine the maximum value in a[]

   // Now search a[] until we find that maximum value
   int i=0;
   // loop invariant: maxVal does not occur in a[0..i-1]
   while (a[i] != maxVal) 
      { i = i+1; }
   return i;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
This works, but notice that determining the maximum requires a complete
"pass" over the array and then finding its first occurrence requires
at least a partial pass and up to a full pass.
If, during the first pass, we remember not only the max-so-far value
but also its location, no second pass would be necessary.
Following this idea, and also assuming that the array's length is
non-zero, we get:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the lowest-numbered location containing a maximum of 
** the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int locOfMax(int[] a)
{
   int maxSoFar = a[0];
   int locOfMaxSoFar = 0;
   // loop invariant: maxSoFar = maximum of the elements in a[0..i-1]  &&
   //                 maxSoFar = a[locOfMaxSoFar]
   for (int i=1; i != a.length; i = i+1)
   {
      if (a[i] > maxSoFar) { 
         maxSoFar = a[i];  locOfMaxSoFar = i;
      }
   }
   return locOfMaxSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
But notice that <tt>maxSoFar = a[locOfMaxSoFar]</tt> is an invariant
of the loop.  Which means that wherever the value of <tt>maxSoFar</tt>
is used, we could just as well use <tt>a[locOfMaxSoFar]</tt>.
Which is to say that we can write the method without the 
<tt>maxSoFar</tt> variable, like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the lowest-numbered location containing a maximum of 
** the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int locOfMax(int[] a)
{
   int locOfMaxSoFar = 0;
   // loop invariant: a[locOfMaxSoFar] = maximum of the elements in a[0..i-1]
   for (int i=1; i != a.length; i = i+1)
   {
      if (a[i] > a[locOfMaxSoFar]) { 
         locOfMaxSoFar = i;
      }
   }
   return locOfMaxSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Generalizing this (as we did for sumOf()) to allow a caller to ask for the
location of a maximum within an array segment, we get this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the lowest-numbered location within a[low..high-1] 
** occupied by a maximum of that segment.
*/
public static int locOfMax(int[] a, int low, int high)
{
   int locOfMaxSoFar = low;
   // loop invariant: a[locOfMaxSoFar] = maximum of the elements in a[low..i-1]
   for (int i=low+1; i != high; i = i+1)
   {
      if (a[i] > a[locOfMaxSoFar]) { 
         locOfMaxSoFar = i;
      }
   }
   return locOfMaxSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
So now we can write the non-generalized version so that it makes use
of the generalized version:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the lowest-numbered location containing a maximum of 
** the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int locOfMax(int[] a) { return locOfMax(a, 0, a.length); }
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


</p><p>
Having written the generalized and non-generalized versions of 
<tt>locOfMax()</tt> in this way, now we can write proper versions 
of <tt>maxOf()</tt>:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the maximum of the elements in the specified array 
** segment (a[low..high-1]).
*/
public static int maxOf(int[] a, int low, int high) { 
   return a[locOfmax(a, low, high)]; 
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns the maximum of the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int maxOf(int[] a) { return maxOf(a,0,a.length); }
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>

<h3>Array Reversal</h3>
</p><p>
Now we consider the problem of reversing the elements in an array.
That is, we want to modify the contents of an array so that, in the end,
the values are in reverse order relative to their original order.

</p><p>
For example, if initially the array were
<center>
<pre>
   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7  
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  5 | 12 | -7 |  2 |  0 | 14 | -1 |  3 |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</pre>
</center>

then, at the end, we would want it to be

</p><p>
<center>
<pre>  
   0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7  
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|  3 | -1 | 14 |  0 |  2 | -7 | 12 |  5 |
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
One way to achieve this result is to carry out a bunch of
<b>swap</b> operations.  This term is commonly used to refer to
the act of interchanging the values of two variables.
In particular, we would swap the values at these pairs of locations:
(0,7), (1,6), (2,5), and (3,4).

</p><p>
Do you detect a pattern here?  Each pair of locations has the same
sum, 7, which, not coincidentally, is one less than the array's length.
Try it with an array of any length and you will see that the same
pattern holds.  Indeed, if the array's length is N (and thus its
index range is 0..N-1), the pairs of locations whose values should
be swapped is (0,N-1), (1,N-2), (2,N-3), ...., each of which 
adds up to N-1.  Thus, letting i be the first (and smaller) component
of any such pair of locations, the second component j must satisfy 
both i+j = N-1 and i < j.  Solving the former for j, we get j = N-1-i.
Thus, each pair of locations whose values should be swapped is of the 
form (i, N-1-i). 

</p><p>
Given that j = N-1-i, the inequality i &lt; j translates to i &lt; N-1-i,
which is equivalent to 2i < N-1.
All this analysis leads to the following Java method, which employs
the yet-to-be-written <tt>swap()</tt> method:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Reverses the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int reverse(int[] a)
{
   final int N = a.length;
   for (int i=0; 2*i < N-1; i = i+1)
   {
      swap(a, i, N-1-i);
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
As the reader should have surmised, the method call <tt>swap(b,k,m)</tt>
is intended to have as its effect to swap the elements at locations 
k and m of array b[].

</p><p>
Before we deal with the design of the <tt>swap()</tt> method,
let's develop an alternative version of <tt>reverse()</tt>.
Above we reasoned that every "swap location pair" (i,j) must
satisfy i &lt; j and j = N-1-i.  We used these to determine the
loop guard and the second argument to be passed to the <tt>swap()</tt>
method.


</p><p>
But we could just as well use j as a program variable and maintain its
value so that j = N-1-i is an invariant.  Here is the new version of
<tt>reverse()</tt>:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre><font color="red">Syntax error!</font>
/* Reverses the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int reverse(int[] a)
{
   final int N = a.length;
   for (int i=0, j=N-1; i < j; i = i+1; j = j-1)
   {
      swap(a, i, j);
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Unfortunately, Java does not allow the third component in a for-loop
heading (the "update the loop control variable" component) to be
a sequence of more than one statement.  Indeed, nor does the compiler
allow it to be a single but compound statement (which you obtain by
enlosing a sequence of statements within curly braces). 
Thus, we cannot update both <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> there.

</p><p>
Since <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> are equally deserving of being the
for-loop's control variable, but we cannot have both of them be 
loop control variables, good style suggests that neither of them be.
So we change the loop into a <b>while-loop</b>.  The resulting 
method looks like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Reverses the elements in the specified array (a[]).
*/
public static int reverse(int[] a)
{
   int i=0, j = a.length - 1;
   while (i < j) 
   {
      swap(a, i, j);
      i = i+1; j = j-1;
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
As for swapping the values of two variables, suppose that you have 
variables <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> and you want to swap their values.
Your first inclination might be to use the following pair of assignments:

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>x = y; y = x;</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
But that won't work, because not only will <tt>x</tt> end up with
<tt>y</tt>'s original value, but so will <tt>y</tt>!  Why?  Because
the first assignment obliterates <tt>x</tt>'s original value, replacing
it with <tt>y</tt>'s.  Thus, the second assignment copies <tt>x</tt>'s
new value (which was <tt>y</tt>'s original value) back into <tt>y</tt>!

</p><p>
To do it correctly, we need to employ an auxiliary variable to
"remember" <tt>x</tt>'s original value and then, after copying
<tt>y</tt>'s value into <tt>x</tt>, to assign the remembered value
to <tt>y</tt>:

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>temp = x; x = y; y = temp;</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
Using the same idea but where the variables being swapped are 
array elements, we get the following method:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Swaps the elements in the specified locations (k and m) of
** the specified array (b[]).
*/
public static void swap(int[] b, int k, int m)
{
   int temp = a[k];
   a[k] = a[m];
   a[m] = temp;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


</p><p>
In analogy with the <tt>sumOf()</tt> and <tt>maxOf()</tt> examples,
we can make the <tt>reverse()</tt> method more versatile by allowing 
a caller to specify an array segment that is to be reversed.
Here it is:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Reverses the elements in the specified array segment (a[low..high-1]).
*/
public static int reverse(int[] a, int low, int high)
{
   int i = <font color="red">low</font>, j = <font color="red">high</font> - 1;
   while (i < j) 
   {
      swap(a, i, j);
      i = i+1; j = j-1;
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
For another variation, consider that the caller may not want to modify
an existing array but rather to create a new array containing the same
values as those in an existing array segment but in reverse order. 
Here is a method that does that:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns a new array whose elements are those in the specified array
** segment (a[low..high-1]) but in reverse order.
** pre: 0 <= low <= high <= a.length
*/
public static int[] reverseOf(int[] a, int low, int high)
{
   final int N = high - low;   // length of array to be returned.
   int[] result = new int[N];  // create array to be returned

   // loop invariant: result[0..i-1] contains the elements in a[high-i..high-1]
   // in reverse order.
   for (int i=0; i != N; i = i+1) {  // Fill new array
      result[i] = a[high-1-i];
   }
   return result;   
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
In case you don't appreciate the difference between the effects of the
methods <tt>reverse()</tt> and <tt>reverseOf()</tt>, here is an example.
Suppose that we have an array <tt>junk[]</tt> as follows:

<pre>        0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
junk |  3 | 12 |  5 | -2 |  0 |  9 | 15 | -4 |  7 |
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+</pre>

</p><p>
Then making the call <tt>ArrayExamples.reverse(junk, 1, 7)</tt>
(here we're assuming that the <tt>reverse()</tt> method is in the
<tt>ArrayExamples</tt> class) will have the effect of reversing
the order of the values occupying <tt>junk[1..6]</tt> so that it
looks like this:

<pre>        0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
junk |  3 | 15 |  9 |  0 | -2 |  5 | 12 | -4 |  7 |
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+</pre>

</p><p>
On the other hand, the call <tt>ArrayExamples.reverseOf(junk, 1, 7)</tt>
will leave the contents of <tt>junk[]</tt> undisturbed but will create,
and return a reference to, a new array like this:
<pre>        0    1    2    3    4    5  
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+
     | 15 |  9 |  0 | -2 |  5 | 12 |
     +----+----+----+----+----+----+</pre>

</p><p>
Of course, the client would not have called the method in the first place
unless it wanted to make use of the resulting array, so typically 
(but not always) such a call would occur on the right-hand side of an
assignment statement.  Typical client code might be like this:

<pre>
   garbage = ArrayExamples.reverseOf(junk, 1, 7);
</pre>

This would assign to <tt>garbage</tt> a reference to the array shown
above.
This assumes, of course, that <tt>garbage</tt> has been declared to
be a variable of type <tt>int[]</tt>.
