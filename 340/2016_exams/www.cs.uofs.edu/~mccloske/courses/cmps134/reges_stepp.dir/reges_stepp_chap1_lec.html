<h3>1.1 Basic Computing Concepts</h3>
<p>
<b>What is computer science?</b>
The name would suggest that it is the study of computers, but that's
not quite right.  As Edsger Dijkstra (1972 ACM Turing Award winner) put it,

<blockquote>
  Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is
  about telescopes.
</blockquote>

The point is that, just as telescopes serve as a tool for studying
the nature of the cosmos (which is the subject of astronomy),
so computers serve as a tool for studying
the nature of <b>computation</b>.
So <b>computation science</b> would be a better term.

</p><p>
Various definitions of computer science have been offered, including
Wikipedia's:
<blockquote>
  The study of theoretical foundations of information and computation
  and their implementation and application in computer systems.
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
As with other academic disciplines, computer science has a number of 
sub-disciplines, including graphics, artificial intelligence, databases,
and networking.

</p><p>
At the center of the discipline, according to Donald E. Knuth
(1974 ACM Turing Award winner), is
<b>algorithmic thinking</b>, which is the kind of thinking needed for
developing <b>algorithms</b>. 
An <b>algorithm</b> is a precisely stated list of instructions for
carrying out some task (typically for the purpose of solving some problem).

</p><p>
Reges and Stepp argue that a good reason for studying programming is that
it is the best way to come to an understanding of algorithmic thinking.

</p><p>
Examples of algorithms include a recipe for making apple pie,
instructions for assembling a piece of exercise equipment, 
for tying a Windsor Knot, for putting on a pair of pants, or
for walking from the parking pavilion to McGuirrin Hall.
</p>
<p>
Algorithms such as these are written in a natural language (e.g., English)
and can be supplemented with pictures, videos, or diagrams.
They are intended to be read/viewed and executed by human beings.  
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the kind of algorithm that we will be focused on in this
course, which is referred to as a <b>computer program</b>, is intended
to be read and executed by a computer, which, being a machine,
is extremely stupid.  (An algorithm that can be carried out by a
machine, with no human intervention, is said to be <b>effective</b>.)
Indeed, unlike humans (who have common sense and intelligence, and thus
are often able to figure out instructions that are ambiguous, unclear, or
plain wrong), a computer follows instructions quite blindly/literally,
just as does a kitchen appliance, an automobile, or a chain saw.
We will find that, as a consequence of this, developing computer programs
that work exactly as intended tends to be more difficult than writing
instructions for making an apple pie.

</p><p>
A computer program, then, is an organized set of instructions that is
intended to be interpreted and executed by a computer.

</p><p>
Knuth, recalling the cliche
<blockquote>
  You don't <em>really</em> understand something until you've taught it.
  <!-- A person doesn't really understand something until after teaching it
  to someone else.
   -->
</blockquote>
noted that it would be more accurate to say
<blockquote>
  You don't <em>really</em> understand something until you've taught it
  to a computer (meaning that you've written an algorithm).
  <!-- A person doesn't <em>really</em> understand something until after
      teaching it to a computer (i.e., by expressing it as a program).
  -->
</blockquote>


</p><p>
Having tried above to provide a sense of what computer science is, 
next we try to address the question <b>What is a computer?</b>

</p><p>
Depending upon how broadly the term is defined, lots of devices can
be classified as computers, including cell phones, calculators, GPS systems,
even Furbies, because all of them carry out instructions that process data.
</p>
<p>
A <b>universal</b> computer is one that is <b>programmable</b>
in one or more languages in which <em>any</em> effective algorithm can be
expressed.
In the 1930's, several mathematicians described different kinds of
"theoretical" computing devices (including the Turing Machine),
all of which turned out to be equally "powerful", meaning 
(in effect) that any algorithm expressible/executable on any one of
them was also expressible/executable on any of the others.
Because no one has yet described a machine with greater capability,
any device with computing power equal to a Turing Machine is said to 
be <b>universal</b>.  Today's PC's and laptop computers are universal, and
these are the kinds of computers that we will use in this course.
</p>
<p>
<b>Hardware and Software</b>:
A computer system includes various physical devices collectively referred
to as <b>hardware</b>.  These devices serve different purposes, but all
contribute to the goal of executing
computer programs, which are referred to collectively as <b>software</b>.
Hardware is tangible, software is not.
One can draw an analogy to, say, an apple pie recipe.  The paper and ink
used in rendering the recipe's instructions have physical existence,
as does the person who carries out the recipe, but the essence of
the recipe is the information it conveys, which is intangible, and
not the medium (paper, ink) on which it is stored.
Similarly, software is physically encoded on a storage device 
(e.g., hard disk or flash drive) and is executed by a processor,
but its essence is found in the instructions that it specifies
(which, as a whole, describes an algorithm).
</p>
<p>
Among the hardware devices that compose a computer system are
<ul>
  <li><b>central processing unit</b> (CPU): it executes instructions</li>
  <li><b>(primary) memory</b> (RAM): where data and programs are stored 
      while in use (short term)
  </li>
  <li><b>(secondary) storage</b> (e.g., magnetic disk (hard disk),
      optical disk (CD, DVD), flash memory, magnetic tape):
      where data and programs are stored (long term)
  </li>
  <li><b>input devices</b>: keyboard, mouse, microphone, game controller</li>
  <li><b>output devices</b>: monitor (screen), printer, speaker,
      actuator (e.g., for robot control)
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Software is typically classified as being in one of two categories:
<b>system</b> or <b>application</b>.
The former refers to software whose purpose is to make the machine
usable or more convenient.  The primary example of system software is the
<b>operating system</b> (e.g., MS Windows 8, Mac OS X, Linux),
which is the program that manages the entire operation of
the machine.
The latter refers to software that performs tasks of direct interest to
users (e.g., game playing, word processing, web browsing).

</p><p>
<b>The Digital Realm</b>:
In a digital computer, all data is stored in the form of digits.
In particular, modern digital computers, for reasons having to do
with engineering concerns (e.g., cost and reliability), encode data
using (physical manifestations of) binary digits, or <b>bits</b>.
A binary digit can be either a <b>0</b> or a <b>1</b>.
(Analogously, a decimal digit is any of <b>0</b>, <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, ...,
or <b>9</b>.)
That is, we can think of all data as being encoded by sequences of
0's and 1's.  For example, the character <b><tt>A</tt></b> is encoded
as <b><tt>01000001</tt></b> under the the widely-used ASCII character-encoding
standard.  And the integer <tt>53</tt> is encoded as <b><tt>00110101</tt></b>
using standard base-2 representation.

</p><p>
Because RAM is organized as groups of bits of length 8, called <b>bytes</b>,
we typically use the byte as a unit of measure of storage usage/capacity.
To refer to quantities in the thousands, millions, billions, etc., of bytes,
we use the prefixes <b>kilo</b> (2<sup>10</sup>, or 1024),
<b>mega</b> (2<sup>20</sup>, or about a million),
<b>giga</b> (2<sup>30</sup>, or about a billion),
<b>tera</b> (2<sup>40</sup>, or about a trillion).
<b>peta</b> (2<sup>50</sup>, or about a quadrillion).
(See Table 1.2, page 6.)

</p><p>
<b>Programs and Programming</b>:
A (computer) program is an organized set of instructions, written in a
particular <b>programming language</b>, that can be executed by a
digital computer.  
</p>
<p>
<b>What is meant by "programming language"?</b>:
A language has <b>syntax</b> and <b>semantics</b>.
<ul>
  <li>A language's syntax is the set of rules that govern whether a given
      expression is valid (i.e., of correct form).
  </li>
  <li>A language's semantics determines the meaning of 
      each valid expression.
  </li>
</ul>

<!--  As an alternative to using English below, could instead illustrate
  syntax and semantics using expressions from high school algebra.

-->

</p><p>
English's syntax, for example, dictates that none of the following are
valid sentences:
<ul>
  <li><em>Cat big fluffy.</em> &nbsp; (lacks a verb)</li>
  <li><em>Ran loose jump.</em> &nbsp; (lacks a subject)</li>
  <li><em>He own a cat.</em> &nbsp; (singular subject, plural verb)</li>
  <li><em>Mary hit he.</em> &nbsp; 
       (direct object in nominative case rather than objective case)
  </li>
  <li><em>Go die in a corner</em>  &nbsp; (lacks a terminator (e.g., period))
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
As for semantics, consider the sentence
<blockquote>Mary threw the round ball.</blockquote>

</p><p>
The meaning of a sentence depends upon the words that appear in it,
what those words refer to, the order in which those words occur, and,
more generally, the structure of the sentence.
Here, two entities are involved, referred to by "Mary" and "ball",
and one action, referred to by "threw".
Also, one quality/characteristic is referred to by "round".

</p><p>
Who did the throwing?  Mary, not the ball.<br />
What was thrown?  The ball, not (necessarily) Mary.<br />
When did it happen?  In the past, according to the verb's tense.<br />
What is round in shape?  The ball, not Mary.

</p><p>
The good news is that the syntax of a typical programming language 
is much simpler than the syntax of English (or other natural languages).
Hence, learning the syntax of Java (the programming language that we
will be using in this course) is easier than learning the syntax
of English.  (On the other hand, people spend years learning English 
while you have only a couple of months to learn Java!)

</p><p>
The bad news is that a Java program will not work (indeed, the computer
will "refuse" to execute it) if it includes even one syntax error!
Indeed, computers are very intolerant of syntax errors.
This is probably in contrast to English teachers that you had in
high school, who may have penalized you for such errors but not
rejected your work outright!

</p><p>
As for semantics, a program "means" what it says to do.
In other words, its meaning is embodied in how the executing
machine behaves when running the program.

</p><p>
<b>Why do we use Java in this course?</b>:
During the past fifteen or so years, Java has become a very popular 
programming language, not only in the software industry but also in
introductory programming courses.
In particular, it is <b>object-oriented</b>, which is currently in favor.
(Later in the course, that term will become meaningful.)

</p><p>
As a first example of a Java program, we give you the following:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   }
} </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
This program, when executed, simply displays the message
<b><tt>Hello, World!</tt></b>, as directed by the
<tt>System.out.println</tt> statement. 
Indeed, the lines that "introduce" the class <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
and the method called <tt>main</tt> don't "do anything" except to
provide structural information.

</p> <p>
<b>Hierarchical structure of a Java program</b>:
The units of a Java program can be described, loosely, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Every Java program is composed of one or more <b>classes</b>,
      each of which is stored in a file whose name matches the class's
      name (and has a <tt>.java</tt> extension).
      Hence, the class above would properly be stored in a file called
      <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>Every class includes zero or more <b>methods</b>, each of
      which can be "called" (or "invoked").
      Our <tt>HelloWorld</tt> program has one method,
      the name of which is <tt>main</tt>.
  </li>
  <li>Every method includes zero or more <b>statements</b>,
      each of which directs the computer to take some particular action 
      or to carry out some operation.
      In <tt>HelloWorld</tt>, the lone statement in the lone method is
      <tt>System.out.println(...)</tt>.
  </li>
</ul>

</p>
<p>
One can make an obvious analogy with a book, which is composed of
chapters, each of which is composed of paragraphs, each of which is
composed of sentences, etc.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the rules above, at least one class in a Java application
must include a method called <tt>main</tt> whose heading matches the one 
(more or less) in the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> class.
It is this method that serves as a program's "entry point", meaning
the place where execution begins.  (Even better, you can think of
program execution as beginning with a call to the <tt>main</tt> method.) 
</p>
<p>
Syntactically, a class begins with a <b>header</b>, followed by its
<b>body</b> enclosed between curly braces.  The same is true for methods.
</p>
<p>
For the moment, don't worry about the meaning of <b>keywords</b> such
as <tt>public</tt>, <tt>static</tt>, or <tt>void</tt>.  In due time,
these will come to make sense to you.
</p>
<p>
<b>Formatting:</b>
Notice how the code in <tt>HelloWorld</tt> is formatted.  Our intent
is to make a class's code as easy to read (for a human) as possible by
providing visual cues (e.g., indentation, similar to a traditional
outline) that suggest the structure of the class.  Different programmers
have different preferences regarding formatting.  The <tt>HelloWorld</tt>
class above is formatted in the style of Kernighan &amp; Ritchie.
Another popular style would have it look like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>public class HelloWorld
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Here, the curly braces that begin and end the body of a class or method
are lined up in the same column.  Notice, however, that the heading of
a method is still indented with respect to the class's heading, and each
statement in a method is indented with respect to the method's heading.
As in a traditional outline, indentation is used to show, for each component,
within which other component it is nested.

</p><p>
Carefully formatting code is strictly for ease of reading (by humans).
From the point of view of the Java compiler, the following version of
<tt>HelloWorld</tt> is identical to those above:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>   public class HelloWorld { public    static void main(String[]
 args) { System.out.println
 ("Hello, World!"); }
      } </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Indeed, we could put the entire program on one line, if we wished.

</p><p>
<b>Comments:</b>
Aside from formatting, another technique that programmers use to help a
reader to understand code more easily is to include <b>comments</b>.
Indeed, comments are included in code to provide such information as
its author(s), the date(s) on which it was written/modified, and known
flaws, as well as both to document its intended behavior and,
in some cases, to explain how that behavior is achieved.
</p>
<p>
The Java compiler "ignores" comments, which is to say that a program's
behavior does not change as a result of adding or removing comments.
</p>
<p>
In Java, comments come in two varieties.  A "rest-of-line" comment begins
with two slashes (<tt>//</tt>) and extends to the end of the line.
The other kind begins with <tt>/*</tt> and extends to the next occurrence
of <tt>*/</tt>, which may be on the same line or any number of lines later.
Here is an augmented version of <tt>HelloWorld</tt> with comments:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Author: J. Programmer
** Date Written: February 31, 1995
** Purpose: Displays the message "Hello, World!"
*/
public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello, World!");  // displays the message
   }
} </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
<b>Identifiers and Keywords</b>:
In the Java language, certain words have a specific meaning and are
reserved to be used only to convey that meaning in particular contexts.
These are called <b>keywords</b> (or, in some languages, <b>reserved</b>
words).  Examples include <b><tt>public</tt></b>, <b><tt>class</tt></b>,
and <b><tt>void</tt></b>.  (See the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> program for
instances of these keywords in context.)  (A list of (all?) 50 Java
keywords appears on page 20 of the textbook.)

</p> <p>
Other words appearing in a program are introduced by a programmer for
the purpose of naming things, such as a class, a method, or a variable.
Such words are called <b>identifiers</b>.
(jGrasp shows keywords in purple and identifiers in black.)

</p><p>
By Java's syntax rules, an identifier must be composed of letters,
underscores (<tt><b> _ </b></tt>), dollar signs (<tt><b>$</b></tt>),
and decimal digits (i.e., any of <tt>0</tt>, <tt>1</tt>, ..., <tt>9</tt>), 
but cannot begin with a digit.
Unlike many programming languages, Java is <b>case sensitive</b>,
meaning, for example, that it recognizes <tt>myDog</tt> and <tt>MydOg</tt>
as being distinct identifiers due to the fact that, even though the letters
match, not all of them agree in case. 

</p><p>
Certain conventions (i.e., common practices that are intended to heighten
uniformity and thereby to aid understanding) exist regarding the form of
identifiers.  Specifically, classes are usually named by a sequence of words,
each of which has only its first letter capitalized.
Identifiers for methods (and variables) look similar, except that the
first word is not capitalized.
This is sometimes called "camel case" (because the outline of an
identifier looks like a camel, where the upper case letters are the humps).

</p> <p>
Examples: <b><tt>HelloWorld</tt></b> is an identifier naming a class, while
<b><tt>doSomethingStupid</tt></b> is an identifier naming a method.


</p><p>
<b>Exploring the <tt>println</tt> and <tt>print</tt> statements</b>:
Augment the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> program by inserting some new
<tt>println</tt> statements to print other messages.
(Note: Actually, such statements are calls/invocations of the
<tt>println</tt> method associated to the object called <b><tt>out</tt></b>
in the library class <tt>System</tt>.)
Observe that each invocation displays a message on a different line.

</p><p>
Now change a few of the <tt>println</tt> invocations to instead invoke
<tt>print</tt>.  Notice that if we invoke <tt>print</tt> followed by
either <tt>print</tt> or <tt>println</tt>, the two messages appear on
the same line.
</p><p>

<b>1.3 Program Errors</b>:
<ul>
  <li><b>syntax</b>: analogous to a grammatical error in English.</li>
  <li><b>logic</b>: the program doesn't perform as expected; gives 
     incorrect results.
  </li>
  <li><b>runtime</b>: Program execution aborts because some specified
     operation cannot be carried out.  Potential causes are a logic error
     (e.g., resulting in division by zero) or invalid input data.
  </li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The textbook (pp. 25-27, 29) illustrates several different kinds of 
<b>syntax errors</b> (specifically, file name does not match class name,
misspelled identifier (<tt>pruntln</tt>, <tt>system</tt>), missing
semicolon, omitting a required keyword (e.g., <tt>class</tt>, <tt>void</tt>),
forgetting to end a comment).
Note that, although the compiler supplies a message
for each error that it finds in a program, the messages are not always
particularly helpful (especially to a beginner) in figuring out exactly
what is wrong.  Also, correcting the first error is usually the best
strategy, because subsequent error messages often are due to the
compiler getting "confused" by the first error.
</p><p>
As an example of a <b>runtime error</b>, could run <tt>MeanProgram</tt>
and supply invalid input.

</p><p>
<b>1.4 Procedural Decomposition</b>: At least two reasons for it:
Make program more understandable (by expressing it in hierarchical
form rather than not) and reduce redundancy.
<b>Example:</b> Recipe for making a cake.  (Page 30.)
Or consider the chapters in a book.
</p><p>
As for removing redundancy, consider the <tt>DrawBoxes</tt> program,
which draws two "boxes" on the console window.  (See page 31.)
</p><p>
Modify it to <tt>DrawBoxes2</tt> by putting the drawing of a box
into a static <tt>drawBox()</tt> method.  Then call it twice from
the <tt>main()</tt> method.

</p></p>
Note that <b>any</b> method, and not just <tt>main()</tt>, can call
other methods.  See <tt>FooBarBazMumble</tt> on page 36.

</p></p>
<b>1.5 Case Study: DrawFigures</b>.
Before we can do this, must explore String literals, in particular
escape sequences, so as to be able to print backslashes.
</p><p>
<b>String literals</b>:
Notice that the messages that we printed using <tt>print</tt> and
<tt>println</tt> were all enclosed in double quotes.  This is how
we specify a <b>String literal</b>.

</p><p>
