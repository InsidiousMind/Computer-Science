Notes on Java's for-loop
</h2>

</p><p>
Almost every computer program that does something interesting has one or
more segments of code that are executed repeatedly.  The programming
language constructs that support this are loops and recursion.
Here we concentrate on loops.  Specifically, we focus on the 
<b>for</b>-loop in Java, which is one of three kinds of loops that
exist in that language.

</p><p>
In a proper usage of a <b>for</b>-loop, there is a <b>loop control variable</b>
(LCV) (typically, but not necessarily, of type <tt>int</tt>) that varies over
a specified range of values.  For each value v in that range, a code segment
(called the loop body) is executed while the LCV has value v.  
Each execution of the loop body is referred to as an <b>iteration</b> of the
loop.

</p><p>
The syntax of a <b>for</b>-loop in Java is this;

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<tt>
for (&lt;<b>LCV-initialization</b>&gt;; &lt;<b>loop guard</b>&gt;;
     &lt;<b>LCV-update</b>&gt;) <br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;<b>loop body</b>&gt;<br />
} </tt>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The <b>LCV-initialization</b> is an assignment statement by which is
established the initial value of the LCV.
(Often the assignment is combined with the LCV's declaration.)
The <b>loop guard</b> is a boolean expression (i.e., one that evaluates to
either <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>) involving the LCV that is used to
determine when no more iterations should take place.
The <b>LCV-update</b> is an assignment to the LCV  (typically to increment or
decrement it by one, or possibly by two or more) that is to be carried out
at the end of each loop iteration.

</p><p>
What follows is a <b>flowchart</b> illustrating flow-of-control through
a for-loop.
