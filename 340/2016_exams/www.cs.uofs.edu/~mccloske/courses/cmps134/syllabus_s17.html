<b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp;  
  <em>Building Java Programs: A Back to Basics Approach</em> (4th edition)
  by Stuart Reges and Marty Stepp, published by Addison-Wesley, 2016.
<br />

<p>
<b>Exams and quizzes:</b>&nbsp;
   Expect a quiz (taking about fifteen minutes) once every week or two.
   Expect a one hour exam in late February or early March 
   and another one in mid April.
   The comprehensive (two-hour) final exam will be sometime during 
   "Final Exam Week", which is May 15-19.
   <!--Exams are "open book", which is to say that you may refer to the
   textbook, class notes, graded programs, etc., during the exam.
   -->
   (Makeup exams will be offered only if circumstances warrant it,
   such as in the case of an emergency or sudden illness.)
</p><p>
<b>Lab (CMPS 034L)</b>: &nbsp;
   Students are required to be registered for CMPS 034L, an associated
   Pass/Fail zero-credit pilot lab course that meets once per week for a 
   110-minute period.
   </p><p>
   In each lab meeting, students working in pairs will carry out exercises 
   and small assignments, some of which will be submitted for grading.
   The work done in a lab will be marked as either <b>not done</b>,
   <b>unsatisfactory</b>, <b>satisfactory</b>, or <b>well done</b>.
   To earn a Pass grade, a student's work must be marked either
   <b>satisfactory</b> or <b>well done</b> in at least 75% of the
   labs.
   </p><p>
   The grade earned in the lab course (100% for Pass and 0% for Fail)
   will be weighted as 10% of the student's grade in the CMPS 134 course.
</p><p>
<b>Programming Assignments:</b>&nbsp;
   </p><p>
   There will be approximately eight programming assignments.
   Grades will be based upon not only correctness but also on
   subjective attributes such as quality of documentation and
   readability.
   </p><p>
   Submitted solutions must include comments that identify the student(s)
   submitting it (e.g., <tt>Chris Smith</tt>), the course and semester
   (in this case, <tt> CMPS 134, Spring 2017</tt>), the assignment
   number (e.g., <tt>Prog. Assg. #2</tt>),
   and a list of names of any persons who provided assistance in
   completing the work.
   They should also include comments that point out any known flaws in
   the work.
   </p><p>
   Work submitted after the deadline is subject to a penalty of seven percent
   per day.  As a general rule, work cannot be submitted more than 72 hours
   past the time that it is due.
   </p><p>
   Students are allowed to collaborate with each other while working
   on assignments, <b>but such collaboration is to be acknowledged, in
   writing, within the submitted work</b>, as mentioned above.
   Collaboration should not go so far that it becomes untruthful for a
   student to claim that submitted work is, for the most part, his or 
   her own (or that of his/her team, in the case of a team project).
   Under no circumstances is a student to copy the work of another or
   to allow another student to copy her/his work.

<b>Grading:</b>
   <p>
   Approximate weights:
   <font face="Courier New,Courier">
   <pre>
       Semester exams and quizzes: 32%
       Final exam:                 20%
       Lab Work                    10%
       Programs/Homework :         36%
       Class Participation:         2%

   Mapping from numerical average to letter grade (approximate):

<b>Intended Course Outcomes</b>
</p><p>
Upon completion of the course, a successful student will have the ability to
do each of the following:
<ul>
  <li>Explain the role of software in computer systems.</li>
  <li>Explain concepts and terminology of Object Oriented Software Development.
  </li>
  <li>Explain the purpose and use of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
      in the development of software.
  </li>
  <li>Read, understand and explain source program components written in the 
      Java programming language.
  </li>
  <li>Readily make use of Java's String class along with several other such
      classes from the Java Standard Library.
  </li>
  <li>Research and make use of other classes from the Java Standard Library, 
      although they may not have been actually demonstrated or used during 
      the course. 
  </li>
  <li>Formulate an abstraction and express it as a complete Java class
      specification consisting of variables (instance and otherwise), and
      methods serving as constructors, observers, mutators, privates, and 
      others as appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>Develop a Java application program to perform some well-defined task
      making appropriate use of user-defined classes as well as classes from
      the Java Standard Library.
  </li>
  <li>Make appropriate use of Java's primitive (i.e. intrinsic) data types,
      operators and control structures, and furthermore have the ability to
      readily master those similarly available in other programming languages.
  </li>
  <li>Make appropriate use of the array data structure in the solution of
      problems and the specifications of tasks for a computer to carry out,
      and to appreciate that other data structures exist and may be applicable. 
  </li>
  <li>Explain searching and sorting in general and be familiar with specific
      algorithms for each.
  </li>
  <li>Recognize the use of recursion and be able to explain it as an 
      alternative to iteration.
  </li>
  <li>Recognize the use and potential value of inheritance in the design of
      software components.
  </li>
  <li>Recognize the use and potential value of interfaces in the design of
      software components. 
  </li>
</ul>
