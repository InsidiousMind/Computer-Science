<h3>Recursive Function Definitions</h3>
</p><p>
Consider the following (mathematical) function, the domain of which is
the natural numbers (i.e., nonnegative integers):

</p><p><center><tt>sumUpTo(n) = 0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n</tt></center>

</p><p>
Given that addition is commutative, we could just as well have written
this as 

</p><p><center><tt>sumUpTo(n) = n + (n-1) + (n-2) +  ... + 0</tt></center>

</p><p>
That is, for any natural number <tt>n</tt>, <tt>sumUpTo(n)</tt> 
is the sum of the integers in the range <tt>0..n</tt>.
For example, <tt>sumUpTo(4) = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0</tt>, or <tt>10</tt>.
<!-- 
  (As a special case, <tt>sumUpTo(0)</tt> is <tt>0</tt>, as the range
  <tt>1..0</tt> is empty and the sum of an empty collection of numbers
  is zero.)
-->

</p><p>
The given definition lacks rigor, because it relies upon an
(intelligent) reader understanding what is meant by "<tt>...</tt>".
Here is a better definition:
<!--
<pre>
   sumUpTo(n) = | 0                 if n = 0  (1)
                | n + sumUpTo(n-1)  otherwise (i.e., n > 0) (2)</pre>
-->

</p></p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td rowspan="2"><tt>sumUpTo(n) =&nbsp;</tt></td>
    <td><tt>{ 0</tt></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>if &nbsp;<tt>n = 0</tt></td>
    <td><b>(1)</b></td>
</tr>
<tr><td><tt>{ n + sumUpTo(n-1)</tt></td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>otherwise (i.e., <tt>n &gt; 0)</tt></td>
    <td><b>(2)</b></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
This definition is based upon the observation that, for <tt>n&gt;0</tt>, the
"sum up to <tt>n</tt>" is just <tt>n</tt> plus the "sum up to <tt>n-1</tt>".
In other words, the "sum up to <tt>n</tt>" is

</p><p><center><tt>n + <b>((n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 0)</b></tt></center>

</p><p>
in which the boldfaced (and parenthesized) part is the 
"sum up to <tt>n-1</tt>".

</p><p>
But is our second definition of <tt>sumUpTo</tt> any more rigorous
than the first?  In the first definition, the "<tt>...</tt>" was
troublesome, but the second is suspicious in that the body of the
definition refers to the function itself.
Does this not lead to a "circularity" (as if <em>field</em> were defined
as <em>meadow</em> and vice versa)?  <b>No!</b>
To demonstrate this, let's apply the function using the second definition:
<pre>
sumUpTo(4) = 4 + sumUpTo(3)             (by (2))
           = 4 + 3 + sumUpTo(2)         (by (2))
           = 4 + 3 + 2 + sumUpTo(1)     (by (2))
           = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sumUpTo(0) (by (2))
           = 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0          (by (1))
</pre>
</p><p>
We got the correct result!  Moreover, it should be clear to the reader
that applying <tt>sumUpTo</tt> to any other natural number 
would lead us, by a similar process, to a correct result.

</p><p>
In the definition, line (1) is referred to as the <b>base case</b>
and line (2) is referred to as the <b>recursive case</b>.
The distinction is that the base case does not refer to the function
being defined, whereas the recursive case does.  The key to making
this work (i.e., to avoid circularity) is that any application of the
function in the recursive case must be to a "smaller" argument (i.e.,
one that is closer to the base case).
That way, during an evaluation of the function, we are certain to 
reach the base case, eventually.

</p><p>
For this function, the pattern is obvious:
An application of <tt>sumUpTo</tt> to <tt>n</tt> leads to an application
of <tt>sumUpTo</tt> to <tt>n-1</tt>, which leads to an application of
<tt>sumUpTo</tt> to <tt>n-2</tt>, etc., etc., until eventually
it is applied to zero (the base case).  This is typical.

</p><p>
Let's develop a more general function that "computes" the sum of any
range <tt>u..v</tt> of integers.  The informal definition is
</p><p><center><tt>sumOfRange(u,v) = u + (u+1) + (u+2) + ... + (v-1) + v
</tt></center>
</p><p>
Observing that (under the assumption <tt>u&le;v</tt>) the sum of the
integers in the range <tt>u..v</tt> is <tt>u</tt> plus the sum of the
integers in the range <tt>u+1..v</tt>, we formulate the recursive definition
<pre>
   sumOfRange(u,v) =  { 0                     if u&gt;v  (1)
                      { u + sumOfRange(u+1,v) otherwise  (2)</pre>

</p><p>
Using this definition to evaluate <tt>sumOfRange(3,6)</tt>, we get
<pre>
             sumOfRange(3,6) 
           = 3 + sumOfRange(4,6)              (by (2))
           = 3 + 4 + sumOfRange(5,6)          (by (2))
           = 3 + 4 + 5 + sumOfRange(6,6)      (by (2))
           = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + sumOfRange(7,6)  (by (2))
           = 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 0                (by (1))</pre>  
which is the correct result.

</p><p>
Alternatively, we could have observed (again assuming that <tt>u&le;v</tt>)
that the sum of the integers in the range <tt>u..v</tt> is the sum of the
integers in the range <tt>u..v-1</tt>, plus <tt>v</tt>.  So we could have
written the recursive case in the definition as
</p><p><center><tt>sumOfRange(u,v-1) + v &nbsp; (2')</tt></center>

</p><p><hr><b>Exercise:</b> Evaluate <tt>sumOfRange(3,6)</tt>, but this
time assume that the definition uses the alternative recursive case (2')
rather than (2).
<hr>

<!--
</p><p>
For that matter, we could observe (again assuming <tt>u &le; v</tt>)
that, for any <tt>w</tt> satisfying <tt>u&le;w&le;v</tt>, the sum of
the integers in <tt>u..v</tt> is the sum of the integers in the range
<tt>u..w</tt> plus the sum of the integers in the range <tt>w+1..v</tt>!
Choosing <tt>w = (u+v)/2</tt>, we are led to the following alternative
definition of the function:
<pre>
   sumOfRange(u,v) =
      { 0                                                  if u&gt;v
      { sumOfRange(u,(u+v)/2)) + sumOfRange(((u+v)/2)+1,v) otherwise </pre>
-->

</p><p>
To make this a little more interesting, let's define a function that
computes the sum of the values in an array segment <tt>a[u..v]</tt>.
(We assume that the elements of the array contain numbers of some kind.)
Informally,
</p><p><center><tt>
  sumOfSeg(a,u,v) = a[u] + a[u+1] + a[u+2] + ... + a[v-1] + a[v]
</tt></center>
</p><p>
Using observations analogous to those we employed in developing our
recursive definition of <tt>sumOfRange</tt>, we get
<pre>
 sumOfSeg(a,u,v) =  { 0                        if u&gt;v  (1)
                    { a[u] + sumOfSeg(a,u+1,v) if 0&le;u&le;v&lt;a.length (2)</pre>

</p><p>
Using this definition to evaluate <tt>sumOfSeg(a,3,6)</tt>, we get
<pre>
    sumOfSeg(a,3,6) 
  = a[3] + sumOfSeg(a,4,6)                      (by (2))
  = a[3] + a[4] + sumOfSeg(a,5,6)               (by (2))
  = a[3] + a[4] + a[5] + sumOfSeg(a,6,6)        (by (2))
  = a[3] + a[4] + a[5] + a[6] + sumOfSeg(a,7,6) (by (2))
  = a[3] + a[4] + a[5] + a[6] + 0               (by (1))</pre>
which is the correct result.


<h3>Recursion in Programming</h3>
</p><p>
How does this notion of recursion relate to computer programming?
Well, just as it makes sense for the "body of" a function's definition 
to refer to the function itself, it makes sense for a method's body
to refer to the method itself.  In other words, in programming,
recursion manifests itself in having methods that call themselves!
Most modern programming languages, including Java, support this
technique.

</p><p>
Here again is our recursive definition of the function <tt>sumOfRange</tt>:
<pre>
   sumOfRange(u,v) =  { 0                     if u&gt;v  (1)
                      { u + sumOfRange(u+1,v) otherwise  (2)</pre>

Adapting it into a Java method, we get

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Returns the sum of the integers in the range u..v
*/
public static int sumOfRange(int u, int v) {
   int result;
   if (u &gt; v)
      { result = 0; }
   else 
      { result = u + sumOfRange(u+1,v); }
   return result;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The correspondence between the two should be quite clear.
Notice that the base case and recursive case correspond to the two
branches of the <tt>if</tt>-statement.  Every properly written
"recursive" method will have a similar feature.
Of course, what is important is that if a client were to make
the method call <tt>sumOfRange(3,6)</tt>, for example,
the value returned to it would be <tt>3+4+5+6</tt>, or <tt>18</tt>.
And, indeed, this is the case.
<!--
  (Consult pages 728-736 in Chapter 12 of Reges &amp; Stepp for an
  explanation of the "mechanics of recursion", i.e., how it is carried
  out on a computer.)
-->

</p><p>
Here again is our recursive definition of function <tt>sumOfSeg</tt>:
<pre>
 sumOfSeg(a,u,v) =  { 0                        if u&gt;v  (1)
                    { a[u] + sumOfSeg(a,u+1,v) if 0&le;u&le;v&lt;a.length (2)</pre>

</p><p>
Expressing it as a Java method (and assuming that the array holds values
of type <tt>int</tt>), we get

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Returns the sum of the values in the segment a[u..v].
**  pre-condition: 0 <= u,v < a.length
*/
public static int sumOfSeg(int[] a, int u, int v) {
   int result;
   if (u &gt; v)
      { result = 0; }
   else 
      { result = a[u] + sumOfSeg(a,u+1,v); }
   return result;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
It turns out &mdash;even if the examples we've done so far might not
illustrate it!&mdash; that recursion is a powerful problem-solving technique.
Indeed, if you have a problem for which the solution (to any non-trivial
instance) can be expressed in terms of one or more "smaller" instances of
the same problem, you can use recursion to solve it.
In most of the examples above, the "problem" involved a range of integers
<tt>u..v</tt> and we were able to express its solution in terms of a
solution to the same problem with respect to the smaller range
<tt>u+1..v</tt>.  In particular, computing the sum of the elements in
<tt>a[u..v]</tt> was expressed in terms of computing the sum of the elements
in (the shorter segment) <tt>a[u+1..v]</tt>.


<h3>Determining the Maximum Value in an Array Segment</h3>
</p><p>
Lest you think that the only kind of problem to be solved using
recursion is one that asks for a sum to be calculated,
consider the problem of identifying the maximum element in an array
segment.  In a segment of length one, the maximum value is, obviously,
the lone element in the segment.  In a longer segment, the maximum is
the larger of the first value and the maximum value in the rest of the
segment.  Assuming that <tt>max</tt> is a function that yields the
larger of its two arguments, we can express this as
<pre>
  maxInSeg(a,u,v) = { a[u]                         if u=v
                    { max(a[u], maxInSeg(a,u+1,v)) otherwise </pre>

</p><p>
As a Java method, one translation is
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Returns the maximum value in a[u..v]
**  pre-condition: 0 <= u <= v < a.length
*/
public static int maxInSeg(int[] a, int u, int v)
   int result;
   if (u == v)
      { result = a[u]; }
   else 
      { result = Math.max(a[u], maxInSeg(a,u+1,v)); }
   return result;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Had we forgotten about the <tt>max()</tt> method in the class
<tt>java.Math</tt>, we might have written the <tt>else</tt> branch
as follows:
<pre>         int maxInRest = maxInSeg(a,u+1,v); 
         if (a[u] > maxInRest) 
            { result = a[u]; }
         else 
            { result = maxInRest; }
</pre>

</p><p><hr>
<b>Exercise:</b> Make the necessary changes to (either version of)
method <tt>maxInSeg()</tt> in order to obtain a method meeting the
following specification:
<pre>
   /** Returns the lowest-numbered location, within the segment a[u..v],
   **  that is occupied by the maximum value in that segment.
   */
   public static int locOfMaxInSeg(int[] a, int u, int v) { ... } </pre>
<hr>

<h3>Reversing an Array Segment</h3>
</p><p>
All the recursive methods that we have developed so far are observers,
in the sense that they calculate results but don't change the state of
any object.  Let's remedy that by developing a method that reverses
the order of the elements in an array segment.  The vital observation is
that to reverse an array segment, it suffices to swap its first and last
elements and to reverse the segment in between them!  That is, to
reverse the segment <tt>a[u..v]</tt>, we swap the values at locations
<tt>u</tt> and <tt>v</tt> and reverse the segment <tt>a[u+1..v-1]</tt>.
(In which order we do these does not matter, as neither operation
"interferes" with the other.)  The base case occurs when the segment's
length is one or less, as then nothing needs to be done to effect a
reversal.  Here is the method:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Reverses the order of the elements in the segment a[u..v].
 **  pre: 0&le;u&le;v+1&le;a.length
*/
public static void reverseSeg(int[] a, int u, int v) {

   if (u >= v) {
      // segment length is <= 1, so nothing need be done
   }
   else {
      swap(a,u,v);            // swap the values at locations u and v of a
      reverseSeg(a,u+1,v-1);  // reverse elements in a[u+1..v-1]
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<hr>
<h3>Sorting an Array Segment</h3>
</p><p>
To sort an array segment <tt>a[u..v]</tt>, we can employ <b>Selection Sort</b>,
which would do this:
<pre>
   for each i in the range u..v {
      Let k be the location of the minimum value in a[i..v];
      swap(a,i,k);
   }</pre>
Of course, the above is Java-like pseudo-code.  Employing pseudo-code
again, but expressing ourselves in a recursive fashion, here is how 
to sort array segment <tt>a[u..v]</tt> using the Selection Sort approach:
<pre>
   if (u >= v) {
      // segment length is <= 1, so nothing needs to be done
   }
   else {
      Let k be the location of the smallest value in a[u..v];
      swap(a,u,k); 
      sort the segment a[u+1..v]
   } </pre>

<b>Exercise:</b> Translate the pseudocode immediately above into a
recursive Java method that sorts array segment <tt>a[u..v]</tt>

<hr>
<h3>Recursive Binary Search</h3>

</p><p>
The binary search strategy (in which we find a "solution" within a
range <tt>low..high</tt> by repeatedly cutting the search space in
half) can be expressed not only using loops (such as we have done
before) but also recursively.  The following recursive method finds
the unique location <tt>k</tt>, where <tt>low&le;k&le;high</tt>,
such that every element in array segment <tt>a[low..k-1]</tt> is
less than <tt><b>key</b></tt>, which is less than or equal to every
element in <tt>a[k..high-1]</tt>.  (Of course, <tt>a[low..high-1]</tt>
is assumed to be in ascending order.)

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Returns the unique value of k in the range low..high satisfying the
**  condition a[low..k-1] &lt; key &le; a[k..high-1]
**  pre: 0 &le; low &le; high &le; a.length and the elements in a[low..high-1] 
**       are in ascending order
*/
int indexOfBinSearch(int[] a, int low, int high, int key)
{
   if (low == high)
      { return low; }    // the only result possible!
   else {
      int mid = (low+high) / 2;
      if (a[mid] < key)         // result must be in the range mid+1..high
      {
         return indexOfBinSearch(a, mid+1, high, key);
      }
      else    // a[mid] &ge; key, so result must be in the range low..mid
      {
         return indexOfBinSearch(a, low, mid, key);
      }
   }
} </pre>

<hr>
<h3>Numbers to Numerals</h3>

</p><p>
In Java, one can use the <tt>Integer.toString()</tt> method to translate
a value of type <tt>int</tt> into a <tt>String</tt> object that expresses
that integer as a decimal numeral (or even a numeral in another base).
For example, the call <tt>Integer.toString(5723)</tt> yields as its result
(a reference to) the String "<tt>5723</tt>".

</p><p>
Even had we not known about the <tt>Integer.toString()</tt> method, we
could have written our own method to do the same thing, like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>public static String intToString(int m) { return "" + m; }</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
This takes advantage of the fact that, when a numeric value is combined
with a String via the concatenation operator, Java automatically
converts the number to a String first (in effect, by implicitly calling
a <tt>toString()</tt> method as just described).

</p><p>
As an academic exercise, let's design a recursive version of our method
<tt>intToString()</tt>.

</p><p>
Recall from above that a recursive solution to the problem of computing
the sum <tt>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n</tt> of the first <tt>n</tt> positive integers
becomes evident when we recognize that, for <tt>n &gt; 0</tt>, this is the
sum of the first <tt>n-1</tt> positive integers (i.e., a smaller instance
of the same problem), plus <tt>n</tt>.

</p><p>
Using <tt>4257</tt> as an example, 
we can make a similar observation regarding
the problem under consideration: 
the string corresponding to <tt>4257</tt> is the concatenation of<br />
(1) the string corresponding to <tt>425</tt> (i.e., "<tt>425</tt>") with<br />
(2) the character corresponding to <tt>7</tt> (i.e., <tt>'7'</tt>).

</p><p>
To state it more generally, for any integer <tt>m</tt>, 
where <tt>m &ge; 10</tt>, the string corresponding to <tt>m</tt> is the
concatenation of<br />
(1) the string corresponding to <tt>m/10</tt> 
   (i.e., <tt>m</tt> with its ones digit chopped off) with <br />
(2) the character corresponding to <tt>m % 10</tt>
    (i.e., the ones digit of <tt>m</tt>).

</p><p>
Assuming that we can figure out how to compute the character corresponding
to an integer less than 10 (e.g., '7' for 7), it will not be difficult 
to transform the plan above into a recursive method in which any
value in the range <tt>0..9</tt> is covered by the base case and 
all greater numbers are covered by the recursive case.


</p><p>
Because there are a finite number of cases for it to handle, a method 
that translates an integer in the range <tt>0..9</tt> into its 
corresponding <tt>char</tt> value is not difficult.  Here is a
brute force approach:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Given an int value in the range 0..9, returns the corresponding
value of type char.  E.g., 4 maps to '4', 7 maps to '7'.
*/
public static char digitToChar(int dig) {
   if (dig == 0)      { return '0'; }
   else if (dig == 1) { return '1'; }
   else if (dig == 2) { return '2'; }
   else if (dig == 3) { return '3'; }
   else if (dig == 4) { return '4'; }
   else if (dig == 5) { return '5'; }
   else if (dig == 6) { return '6'; }
   else if (dig == 7) { return '7'; }
   else if (dig == 8) { return '8'; }
   else if (dig == 9) { return '9'; }
   else { return 'X'; }  // shouldn't happen
}
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
With a little knowledge about how values of type <tt>char</tt> are 
represented internally, we could have written the method above to be
not only more concise, but also more efficient in terms of execution time.
The knowledge we need is that the <tt>char</tt> values <tt>'0'</tt>
through <tt>'9'</tt> are represented by consecutive integer values
and that, in Java, if <tt>k</tt> is an expression of type <tt>int</tt>
having value in the range <tt>0..9</tt>, then the expression
<tt>(char)('0' + k)</tt> is the value of type <tt>char</tt> corresponding
to <tt>k</tt>.  For example, <tt>(char)('0' + 5)</tt> has value equal to
<tt>'5'</tt>.

</p><p>
Armed with this knowledge, we can rewrite our <tt>digitToChar()</tt>
method as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Given an int value in the range 0..9, returns the corresponding
value of type char.  E.g., 4 maps to '4', 7 maps to '7'.
*/
public static char digitToChar(int dig) { return (char)('0' + dig); }
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Using the method above, we can now write the method of interest:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/** Given a nonnegative int value, returns the corresponding decimal
** numeral in the form of a String.  E.g., 5234 maps to "5234".
*/
public static char intToString(int m) 
{ 
   if (m < 10) { return "" + digitToChar(m); }
   else { return intToString(m / 10) + digitToChar(m % 10); }
}
</td></tr>
</table>

<h3>Loops vs. Recursion</h3>
</p><p>
Interestingly, any algorithm that can be expressed using loops
can be expressed recursively, and vice versa.  Hence, if we have
one construct, we don't need the other.  But having both at our
disposal is advantageous because, depending upon the
circumstance/context, one is sometimes preferable to the other.
From the standpoint of efficiency (running time and memory usage),
loops are usually superior.  From the standpoint of elegance and
readability, recursion is often superior.  Indeed, some algorithms
can be expressed concisely and elegantly using recursion but less so
using loops.  Perhaps the best-known example is <b>Quick Sort</b>,
developed in about 1960 by C.A.R. Hoare.
