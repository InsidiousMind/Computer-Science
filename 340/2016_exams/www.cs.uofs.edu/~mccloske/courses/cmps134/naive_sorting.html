  Naive (Elementary) Sorting Algorithms
</h2>

</p><p>
In computer science, the verb <b>sort</b> means to rearrange a
list of items so that they end up in either <b>ascending</b> 
(from least to greatest) or <b>descending</b> (from greatest to least)
order.  
There are at least three well known sorting algorithms that, because
of their simplicity, are often referred to as being <em>naive</em>.
Here we will describe two of them.  Our descriptions assume that the
items are to be put into ascending order; the reader should have no
difficulty in adjusting the algorithms so that the items are put into
descending order. 



</p><p>
<h3>Selection Sort</h3>
</p><p>
We are given a list of N items occupying positions 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.
We scan the entire list in order to find the smallest item and then we swap
it with whatever item is at position zero.  Having placed the smallest
item where it belongs &mdash;at position zero&mdash; it remains to sort
the items in positions 1 through N-1.
So we scan those items in order to find the smallest among them,
and then we swap it with the item at position one.  
Having done that, it remains to sort the items in positions 2 through N-1.
So we find the smallest item among those and swap it with whatever item is
at position 2.  And so on and so on.

</p><p>
Assuming that the list to be sorted is given in the form of an array
<tt>a[]</tt>, we can express the algorithm in pseudocode like this:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4"
<tr><td>
<pre>
N = a.length;
for each i in the range 0..N-1 {
   k = location of smallest value in a[i..N-1]
   swap values in locations i and k of a[]
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Note that during the last iteration of the loop, when <tt>i</tt>
has value <tt>N-1</tt>, the location of the smallest element in
<tt>a[i..N-1]</tt>, which is the one-element array segment
<tt>a[N-1..N-1]</tt>, is necessarily <tt>N-1</tt>.
Hence the item at location <tt>N-1</tt> will be swapped with itself,
which has no effect.
For this reason, there is no point in performing a loop iteration
during which the (loop control) variable <tt>i</tt> has value
<tt>N-1</tt>.  So we can change the specified range to 
<tt>0..N-2</tt>.

</p><p>
Translating this into a Java method that sorts an array of <tt>int</tt>'s
(and that makes use of auxiliary methods for finding the minimum value in 
an array segment and for swapping two elements of an array, both of which
were developed during class meetings), we get this:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4"
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Sorts the given array into ascending order using the Selection Sort
** algorithm.
*/
public static void selectionSort(int[] a)
{
   final int N = a.length;
   for (int i = 0; i < N-1; i = i+1) 
   {
      int k = locOfMin(a, i, N);  // find location of min value in a[i..N-1]
      swap(a,i,k);                // swap values in locations i and k of a[]
   }
}

/* Returns a location containing the minimum value in b[low..high-1].
** More precisely: Returns the smallest value k such that low &le; k &lt; high
** and no value in b[low..high-1] is less than b[k]. 
*/
public static int locOfMin(int[] b, int low, int high)
{
   int locOfMinSoFar = low;
   for (int j = low+1; j < high; j = j+1) {
      if (b[j] < b[locOfMinSoFar]) {
         locOfMinSoFar = j;
      }
   }
   return locOfMinSoFar;
}

/* Swaps the elements at locations m and n of array b[]
*/
public static void swap(int[] b, int m, int n) {
   int temp = b[n]; b[n] = b[m]; b[m] = temp;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
<b>Example:</b>
Suppose that the given array is

</p><p>
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 13| 3 | 9 | -2| 6 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
Then successive iterations of selection sort will have these effects:

</p><p>
During the first iteration, the elements at locations 0 and 3 are swapped,
resulting in:
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| -2| 3 | 9 | 13| 6 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
During the second iteration, the elements at locations 1 and 1 are swapped
(which has no effect), resulting in:
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| -2| 3 | 9 | 13| 6 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
During the third iteration, the elements at locations 2 and 5 are swapped,
resulting in:
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| -2| 3 | 4 | 13| 6 | 9 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
During the fourth iteration, the elements at locations 3 and 4 are swapped,
resulting in:
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| -2| 3 | 4 | 6 | 13| 9 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
During the fifth (and final) iteration, 
the elements at locations 4 and 5 are swapped, resulting in:
<center>
<pre>0   1   2   3   4   5
+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| -2| 3 | 4 | 6 | 9 | 13|
+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</center>

</p><p>
<b>Analysis</b>:
</p><p>
The loop in the <tt>selectionSort()</tt> method iterates with
(the loop control) variable <tt>i</tt> assuming the values 0, 1, 2, ..., N-2,
where <tt>N</tt> is the length of the array <tt>a[]</tt> being sorted.
During each of those iterations, the method <tt>locOfMin()</tt> is
called in order to find a location within array segment <tt>a[i..N-1]</tt>
(which has length <tt>N-i</tt>) containing that segment's minimum value.

</p><p>
Examining the code in <tt>locOfMin()</tt>, we notice that the number
of comparisons performed (which is equal to the number of loop iterations)
is one less than the length of the array segment on which it operates.
(During its loop iterations, the loop control variable <tt>j</tt> assumes
the values <tt>low+1</tt> through <tt>high-1</tt>, which is a range of 
<tt>high-low-1</tt> values, in order to find the minimum value in 
array segment <tt>b[low..high-1]</tt>, which has length <tt>high-low</tt>.)

</p><p>
We conclude that, during each iteration of the loop in 
<tt>selectionSort()</tt>, the call to <tt>locOfMin()</tt> results in the
latter performing <tt>N-i-1</tt> comparisons (equivalently, loop iterations).
The following table illustrates this.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th>Value of i in<br /><tt>selectionSort()</tt></th>
    <th># comparisons/iterations<br />performed<br />in <tt>locOfMin()</tt></th>
<tr><td>0</td><td>N-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>N-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>N-3</td></tr>
<tr><td>.</td><td>.</td>
<tr><td>.</td><td>.</td>
<tr><td>N-4</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>N-3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>N-2</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
So how many comparisons (equivalently, loop iterations) does the
<tt>locOfMin()</tt> method perform, in total, including all 
<tt>N-1</tt> times it is called by <tt>selectionSort()</tt>?
The answer is the sum of the numbers in the second column of the table.
It is well known that, for any natural number <tt>N</tt>  the 
sum <tt>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-2) + (N-1)</tt> has value
<tt>(N-1)N/2</tt>, or <tt>(N<sup>2</sup>-N)/2</tt>, which,
for large values of <tt>N</tt>, is close to <tt>N<sup>2</sup>/2</tt>.
</p><p>
We conclude that the selection sort algorithm takes time proportional
to the square of the length of the array that it sorts.
To give you a sense of how this running time increases with respect
to array length (i.e., the running time's <b>growth rate</b>), 
look on the Internet for a graph of the function y = x<sup>2</sup>.  
Notice that, for nonnegative values of x, as x increases not only does 
the function increase but its slope increases.  Indeed, the slope of
the function at each such value of x is 2x (as that is the derivative
of the function).

</p><p>
To get a feel for the increase in running time as the array grows in
length, consider that it will take <b>four</b> times as long to sort an array
of length <tt>2N</tt> as it will to sort an array of length <tt>N</tt>
(because (2N)<sup>2</sup> = 4N<sup>2</sup>).  That is, doubling the
length of the array quadruples the running time.

</p><p>
It turns out that there are more complicated sorting algorithms having
running times proportional to <tt>N &times; log N</tt>, which is a
significant improvement.  Such algorithms are studied in subsequent
computer science courses.

<h3>Insertion Sort</h3>

</p><p>
We are given a list of N items occupying positions 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1.
Assume that we have already rearranged the items in positions
0 through i-1 so that they are in ascending order.  Now we consider
the item x at position i.  Where should x be inserted, relative to the
items in positions 0 through i-1, so that x is in its rightful place
among them?  The answer is that x should be inserted at the first position,
call it k, containing a value greater than x.  (If there is no such 
position, x must be greater than the item at position i-1 and therefore
it belongs where it is already, at position i.)  Of course, 
if we insert x at position k, the items formerly occupying positions 
k through i-1 will now occupy positions k+1 through i.

</p><p>
Assuming that the list to be sorted is given in the form of an array
<tt>a[]</tt>, we can express the algorithm in pseudocode like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><pre>
N = a.length;
for each i in the range 1..N-1 {
   x = a[i]  // store a[i] in a safe place
   k = smallest number in range 0..i such that either k==i or x < a[k]
   shift elements in segment a[k..i-1] one place "upward"
   a[k] = x 
}</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Note that there is no reason to carry out an iteration with i=0 because
nothing of significance would occur during it.

</p><p>
Translating this into a Java method that sorts an array of <tt>int</tt>'s
(and that makes use of of auxiliary methods for computing k and for
shifting an array segment), we get this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Sorts the given array into ascending order using the Insertion Sort
** algorithm.

public static void insertionSort(int[] a)

   {
      int x = a[i];                       // store a[i] before it gets overwritten 
      int k = locOfLeastGreater(a,0,i,x); // find location at which to insert x
      shiftUp(a,k,i);                     // shift a[k..i-1] one place "upward"
      a[k] = x;                           // store x into its rightful place
   }

   }
   return m;
}

/* This method performs the same service as the one above, but it employs

*/
public static int locOfLeastGreater'(int[] b, int bottom, int top, int val) 
{

      else  // val &gt; b[mid]
         { high = mid; }
   }
   return low;

/* Shifts the elements in the segment b[bottom..top-1] "upwards" so that,

<b>Analysis</b>:
</p><p>
The loop in the <tt>insertionSort()</tt> method iterates with the 
loop control variable <tt>i</tt> assuming the values 1,2,3,...,N-1,
where <tt>N</tt> is the length of the array <tt>a[]</tt> being sorted.
During each of those iterations, the methods <tt>locOfLeastGreater()</tt>
and <tt>shiftUp()</tt> are called in order, respectively, to find the
location <tt>k</tt> into which the value at location <tt>i</tt> should
be written and to shift the elements in the segment <tt>a[k..i-1]</tt>
"upward" by one position.  In both of these methods, the number of 
loop iterations is essentially <tt>i-k</tt>.  In the worst case,
<tt>k=0</tt>, which happens when <tt>a[i]</tt> is less than 
<tt>a[0]</tt>.  In the best case, <tt>k=i</tt>, which happens when
<tt>a[i]</tt> is found to be greater than <tt>a[i-1]</tt>.
If we assume that the elements in <tt>a[]</tt> are more or less in
random order to begin with, it would be reasonable to estimate that,
on average, we'll have <tt>k = i/2</tt>, corresponding to the
value of <tt>a[i]</tt> being smaller than about half of the elements
in <tt>a[0..i-1]</tt>.

<!--
N-1 times, 
During each iteration, an array segment <tt>a[k..i-1]</tt> is shifted,
which requires <tt>i-k</tt> loop iterations within the <tt>shiftUp()</tt>
method.  In the worst case, we will have <tt>k=0</tt> each time so that
the number of loop iterations within <tt>shiftUp()</tt> is <tt>i</tt>.
(This would happen if the original array were in descending order.)

</p><p>
It follows that the 
and the element 
In the worst case, <tt>k==0</tt> so that the length of the segment
shifted is <tt>i</tt>.  Of course, the cost of shifting an array segment
is proportional to the length of the segment.  Indeed, let us charge
one time unit for each array element that is 
 of length at most <tt>i</tt>
is shifted.

</p><p>
So how many loop iterations are performed by each of the
<tt>locOfLeastGreater()</tt> and <tt>shiftUp()</tt> methods,
in total, including all <tt>N-1</tt> times they are called
by <tt>insertionSort()</tt>?  Summing up the numbers in the
last three columns of the table, we find that, in the best case,
zero, in the worst, approximately <tt>N<sup>2</sup>/2</tt>,
and, in the average case, approximately <tt>N<sup>2</sup>/4</tt>.

</p><p>
What this tells us is that <tt>insertionSort()</tt> will, like
<tt>selectionSort()</tt>, typically require time proportional 
to <tt>N<sup>2</sup></tt> to complete its task.
However, if the array to be sorted is "almost" in order to begin 
with, <tt>insertionSort()</tt> can take as little as time 
proportional to <tt>N</tt>.   This would be the case, for example,
if there were a constant c such that, in the given array, every
element was at a location no farther than c locations away from
where it ended up when sorting was completed.
