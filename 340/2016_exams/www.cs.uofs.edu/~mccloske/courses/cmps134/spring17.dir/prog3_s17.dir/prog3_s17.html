    Programming Assignment #3: Calendar Date Lexer<br />
    Due: 11:59pm, Thursday, March 23

<h3>Background: Lexical Analysis</h3>
</p><p>
In computer science, the term <em>lexical analysis</em> refers to the
process of identifying, within a string of characters, its smallest
meaningful component parts, called <em>lexemes</em>.  
When (the source code of) a Java class is provided as input to a
Java compiler, the compiler's first action is to apply its
lexical analyzer (or <em>lexer</em>, for short) for the purpose of
identifying each occurrence of a keyword, identifier, comment,
literal (numeric or otherwise), operator (arithmetic, relational), 
etc., etc.

</p><p>
The next phase of compilation is <em>syntactic analysis</em>, in which
the sequence of lexemes identified during lexical analysis is processed
in order to determine whether or not the original source code is free
of syntax errors and, if so, to build an intermediate representation of
the program that can be converted into executable code (called
<em>bytecode</em> in the case of Java).

</p><p>
To make an analogy, lexical analysis in the context of analyzing 
sentences written in English would correspond to finding the 
individual words and punctuation symbols and in determining each
word's part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
Syntactic analysis would then correspond to diagramming each
sentence (e.g., by identifying subjects, verbs, direct objects,
prepositional phrases, etc.).

<h3>Background: Calendar Dates</h3>
</p><p>
Calendar dates are expressed in several different formats,
but they all convey the same three pieces of information: month,
day, and year.  Several formats in common use are listed in
<a href="https://en/wikipedia/org/wiki/Calendar_date">Wikipedia's 
Calendar_date entry</a>.

</p><p>
For this particular programming assignment, we will be interested
in four calendar date formats, which we illustrate here using examples:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
  <th>Format Name</th><th>Example 1</th><th>Example 2</th><th>Example 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Y_MONTH_D</td>
  <td>"<tt>2013 SEPTEMBER 5</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>55 MARCH 15</tt>"</td><td>"<tt>1964 APRIL 10</tt>"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>M/D/Y</td>
  <td>"<tt>11/29/2019</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>2/5/1915</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>7/4/576</tt>"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Y-M-D</td>
  <td>"<tt>1974-04-08</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>0002-05-23</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>1678-12-19</tt>"</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DMonY</td>
  <td>"<tt>7Dec1954</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>26Apr674</tt>"</td>
  <td>"<tt>12May1825</tt>"</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The double quotes surrounding each date are not part of the date
itself, but are there simply to emphasize that each date is a
string with no leading or trailing spaces.

</p><p>
Notice that, among the four formats of interest to us, only
Y-M-D requires all three components (year, month, and day) to
be expressed using fixed-length fields, including leading zeros
for padding if necessary.  (We will assume that only years in
the range 0..9999 are of interest to us, so that four digits
are always sufficient.)  The only other field of fixed length
is the month within the DMonY format, which has length three.

</p><p>
Given a calendar date in a particular format, identifying its
component parts (i.e., lexically analyzing it) is fairly easy.
This is especially so for the Y-M-D format, because each of its
fields is fixed in length.  The Y_MONTH_D and M/D/Y formats are
easy, too, because in each one the fields are separated by a
particular character that acts as a <em>delimiter</em>: 
space in the former and slash in the latter.
The DMonY format is slightly more difficult, because there is
no delimiter.  Rather, the month field begins with the first
occurrence of a letter and ends with the last.  (Or, perhaps
better: it begins with the first occurrence of a letter and has
length three).


<h3>Requirements</h3>
</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to finish the development of an incomplete
Java class, called <a href="CalendarDateLexerZZ.java">CalendarDateLexer</a>.
As its name suggests, its purpose is to act as a lexer 
(i.e., lexical analyzer) on strings that are (assumed to be)
calendar dates.

</p><p>
Specifically, the class includes twelve public methods, three for
each of the four calendar date formats introduced above.
The three methods devoted to dates in the Y-M-D format are
<tt>yearFromYMD()</tt>, <tt>monthFromYMD()</tt>, and
<tt>dayFromYMD()</tt>.  The methods devoted to the other
formats are similarly named, with <tt>YMD</tt> replaced in an
obvious way.

</p><p>
As the method names suggest, each one has as its purpose to
return the appropriate substring of the calendar date that it
receives via its formal parameter.  For example, the call
<tt>monthOfYMD("1974-04-08")</tt> should evaluate to "<tt>04</tt>".

</p><p>
In order to complete the class, you will have to develop the bodies
of several of the methods.  Each one is well marked by a comment that 
says "STUB!".  
(The term "stub" refers to a method whose body is essentially empty.)

</p><p>
Keep in mind that the methods in <tt>CalendarDateLexer</tt>
are <b>not responsible</b> for verifying the validity of the
calendar dates passed to them as parameters.  They are responsible
for providing "meaningful" results only when given valid dates.
Thus, when developing the code for each method, assume that the 
String passed to it via its formal parameter is a valid calendar date
in the assumed format.

<h3>Testing Your Work</h3>
</p><p>
In order to make it convenient to test your work, provided is a
Java application program
<a href="CalendarDateLexerTester.java">CalendarDateLexerTester</a>
and an <a href="cal_dates.txt">accompanying data file</a>.
The program reads data from a file, under the assumption that 
each line of data contains a calendar date format identifier followed 
by a calendar date in that format.
For each line of input data, the program echos the indicated
format and date, followed by (on successive lines) the year, month,
and day components of the date.
Of course, it obtains the year, month, and day components by calling 
the appropriate methods of the <tt>CalendarDateLexer</tt> class.

</p><p>
To the right appears sample input data (as could appear in the
data file) and the output that the program should produce if
fed that input data.  The output that it actually produces will
depend upon the methods in the <tt>CalendarDateLexer</tt> class
that the student is responsible for completing.

</p><p>
How does the application program "know" from which data file to read
its input?  <b>Answer:</b>
<ul>
  <li>If a <b>command line argument</b> (or what jGrasp refers to as a 
    <b>run argument</b>) is specified when the program is run, 
    that argument is taken to be the name of the input file.
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise, the program prompts the user to enter the name
    of the input file and takes the response as being that name.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<a name="runarg">
The next likely question is: How is a run argument specified when a
Java program is run via jGrasp? <b>Answer:</b>

<ol>
  <li>Make the application program to be run the current class 
      (by clicking on the window containing its source code).
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Build</b> (in the Menu Bar) so that the associated
      menu appears.
  </li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Run Arguments</b> box on the menu so that it has a
      checkmark in it.
      A text box should immediately appear above the application program's
      source code.
  </li>
  <li>Enter into that text box one or more run arguments, separated by
      spaces.  For this program, you would enter <tt>cal_dates.txt</tt>
      (or the name of whatever file you want to use as input).
  </li> 
  <li>Click on the Run icon.
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
A sample input data file is provided, as indicated above.
But you are encouraged to make up your own input data, or to modify
that which was given.  A good choice of a text editor for this
purpose is the one provided by jGrasp.  To make a new file, 
click on <b>File</b>, then follow the path through <b>New</b>, 
</b>Other</b>, and <b>Plain Text</b>.

<hr>
<h3>Program Submission</h3>
Submit your source code file (<tt>CalendarDateLexer.java</tt>) from
the course web page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent
to the link that brought you to this page.  (Again, submit <b>only</b>
the <tt>CalendarDateLexer.java</tt> file, 
<b>not</b> the corresponding <tt>.class</tt> file and <b>not</b>
any other <tt>.java</tt> file.)
Make sure to augment the comments in the given program so that you
identify yourself, acknowledge any persons who aided you in developing
your solution, and point out any flaws that you know about.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit more than one time.  Hence, if, after
submitting, you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors),
you should submit the newer version.
