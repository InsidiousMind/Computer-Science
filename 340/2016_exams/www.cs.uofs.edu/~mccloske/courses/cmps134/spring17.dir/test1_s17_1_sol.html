<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
Test #1 (Section 1) Sample Solutions</h2>

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Correct answers were indicated on graded test papers.

</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(h)</b>, the nested loop iterates a total of 12
times (because it iterates three times during each of the four
iterations of the outer loop), and prints three *'s each time,
for a total of 36 *'s.

</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(i)</b>, the outer loop iterates with its control
variable <tt>j</tt> assuming the values 1 through 6.
During each of those iterations, the nested loop iterates with its
control variable <tt>k</tt> assuming values going from <tt>j</tt>'s
current value up to and including 5.  This is depicted in the following
table.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpaddint="4">
<tr><th>Value of <tt>j</tt></th>
    <th>Values assumed by <tt>k</tt></th>
    <th># of iterations</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1,2,3,4,5</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2,3,4,5</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>3,4,5</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4,5</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>none</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Adding up the values in the rightmost column yields the total number
of iterations of the nested loop.  That number is 15.
Because each such iteration prints a single *, 15 is the number
of *'s that are printed.

</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(j)</b>, the outer loop iterates with its control
variable <tt>i</tt> assuming the values 6,3, and 0.
During each of those iterations, the nested loop iterates with its
control variable <tt>j</tt> assuming values going from 0 up to
and including <tt>i</tt>'s current value.
This is depicted in the following table.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpaddint="4">
<tr><th>Value of <tt>i</tt></th>
    <th>Values assumed by <tt>j</tt></th>
    <th># of iterations</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>0,1,2,3,4,5,6</td><td>7</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>0,1,2,3</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Adding up the values in the rightmost column yields the total number
of iterations of the nested loop.  That number is 12.
Because each such iteration prints a single *, 12 is the number
of *'s that are printed.

<a href="Test1DrawFigure.java">Test1DrawFigure</a>.
As for how to modify the <tt>drawFig()</tt> method so that it can
draw figures using a different combination of characters, chosen
by the caller, the answer is to use <b>parameters</b>!
A second version of the <tt>drawFig()</tt> method, with not only
a <tt>size</tt> parameter but also four parameters of type <tt>char</tt>,
is in the given program.
