<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
Final Exam Preview
</h2>


<p>
Having already taken two tests in this course, you should be familiar
with the kinds of questions likely to be on the final exam.  
For more specific guidance, the following is offered.

<ul>
  <li><b>Terminology:</b>
    Expect questions (such as appeared in the tests) that gauge
    your understanding of various terms that are used in the realm of 
    programming (and Java programming in particular).  Given some 
    Java code, be able to identify examples of various elements of the
    Java language, such as variable declarations, method headings, 
    comments, String literals, assignment statements, etc., etc.  
    Given a statement about Java programming that is missing one or more
    words, be able to supply what's missing to make the statement accurate.
  </li> 
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Reading/Evaluating Code:</b>
    Given some Java code (perhaps a code segment, or a method, or an
    entire application) together with input data for it to consume
    (either from the keyboard or via parameter passing),
    be able to tell what happens during execution
    (e.g., what output the code produces or the progression of 
    values taken on by its variables).
    </p><p>
    In particular, in recent days we discussed <b>Binary Search</b>,
    <b>Selection Sort</b>, and <b>array partitioning</b>.
    Given code that implements any of those algorithms,
    plus an array on which to operate, you should be able to give a precise
    account of what happens during execution.  For example, identify those
    locations of the array that are examined during a binary search or 
    which pairs of array elements get swapped during a selection sort.
    </p><p>
    Near the end of the semester, we discussed <b>recursion</b>.
    Given a recursive method (i.e., one that calls itself) and values
    provided to it via its parameter(s), be able to mimic its execution
    (so as to tell what it prints or what value it returns) and perhaps
    even apprehend its purpose.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Abstraction and Representation Issues:</b>
    During the latter half of the course, we discussed several 
    "instance classes" (i.e., ones intended to define new data types 
    and to serve as "blueprints" for objects) 
    <!-- from which objects were intended to be created)-->
    that implement "abstractions" of various kinds.
    Among these were classes giving rise to objects that represent/mimic
    tossable coins, six-sided dice, umpire clickers, wraparound counters,
    and multiple-choice test scorers.
    </p><p>
    One of the keys to designing such a class is to choose a set of
    <b>instance variables</b> that, when utilized in tandem, support 
    all the desired capabilities of objects of that class (which are
    manifested in the public methods of the class).
    A key, then, to understanding how such objects are able to exhibit their
    capabilities is to understand how the instance variables are used.
    </p><p>
    Expect at least one test problem that gauges your understanding of
    how instance variables are utilized in a class that we have studied,
    or perhaps in a similar class.  For example, you should understand
    how each of the instance variables of a <tt>MultipleChoiceTestScorer</tt>
    object contributes to that object's ability to carry out its various
    operations.  How should the values of those variables change as a
    result of one or more calls to the class's mutator method?
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Developing/Modifying Code:</b>
    Expect to be asked to develop some Java code that involves the
    manipulation of <b>String</b> objects and/or <b>arrays</b>.
    Perhaps you will be given an incomplete Java instance class and
    asked to supply code missing from one or more of its methods.
  </li>
</ul>
