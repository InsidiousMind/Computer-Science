<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
    Programming Assignment #2: Wind Chill Table<br />
    Due: 11:59pm, Thursday, March 2
</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
</p><p>
When human skin is exposed to cold air, it loses heat.  As air flow
increases, the rate at which heat is lost increases.  Hence, it
"feels" colder on a windy day than on a calm day, even if the air
temperatures are the same on the two days.

</p><p>
For a given air temperature T and wind velocity V, the wind chill factor 
WCF(T,V) is the temperature at which windless air would
have the same cooling effect upon exposed skin.  In other words,
an air temperature of WCF(T,V) with no wind "feels" similar 
to an air temperature of T with wind velocity V.
(Of course, the notation WCF(T,V) is meant to indicate the
application of the two-argument function WCF (which stands for
"Wind Chill Factor") to the two numeric values T and V 
representing temperature and wind velocity.)

</p><p>
A wind chill chart and the formula by which to compute WCF(T,V) (where T 
is a measurement on the Fahrenheit scale and V is measured in MPH 
(miles per hour)) can be found on the National Weather Service's web site at 
<a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/winter/windchill-images/windchillchart3.pdf">

<h3>Requirements</h3>
</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to finish the development of an incomplete
Java application, called <a href="WindChillTableZZ.java">WindChillTable</a>, 
that produces a table of wind chill factors for a range of air temperatures and 
a range of wind velocities.  The range of wind velocities begins at 5MPH and 
goes up to 60MPH at intervals of 5MPH.  
The range of air temperatures and the interval between successive temperatures 
are provided as inputs by the user in response to prompts generated by the 
program.

</p><p>
To illustrate the intended behavior of the program, here is a user-computer
dialog resulting from a sample execution of the program 
(with user input shown in <font color="red">red</font>):

</p><p>
Notice that all three inputs must be integer values.

</p><p>
In order to complete the program, you will have to insert code in several
places, all of which are well marked by a comment that says either 
"STUB!" or "Here insert code to ...".  (The term "stub" refers to a
method whose body is essentially empty.)

</p><p>
As a model, you should use the
<a href="SquareRootTable.java">SquareRootTable</a> application,
the behavior of which is very similar to that of <tt>WindChillTable</tt>
in that it, too, generates a table of numbers.
In particular, take notice of its basic modular structure.
Also notice its use of the <tt>System.out.printf()</tt> method, which
allows the programmer to "format" output nicely (e.g., so that numbers
can be properly lined up in columns).
Also notice its use of the <tt>Math.sqrt()</tt> method. 
The method that you will need to call is <tt>Math.pow()</tt>, 
which computes the result of raising a specified number to a specified power.
(There is no exponentiation operator in Java.)


<h3>Program Submission</h3>
Submit your source code file (<tt>WindChillTable.java</tt>) from
the course web page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent
to the link that brought you to this page.  (Again, submit the
<tt>.java</tt> file, <b>not</b> the <tt>.class</tt> file.)
Make sure to augment the comments in the given program so that you
identify yourself, acknowledge any persons who aided you in developing
your solution, and point out any flaws that you know about.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit more than one time.  Hence, if, after
submitting, you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors),
you should submit the newer version.
