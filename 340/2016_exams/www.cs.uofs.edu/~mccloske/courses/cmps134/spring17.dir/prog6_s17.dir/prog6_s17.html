  CMPS 134  Spring 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #6: Multiple Choice Test Scorer<br />
  Due: 11:59pm, Wednesday, May 10
</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java class
<a href="MultipleChoiceTestScorerZZ.java">MultipleChoiceTestScorer</a>.
An object/instance of this class is for the purpose of scoring a
multiple choice test taken by a group of students.

</p><p>
In creating a <tt>MultipleChoiceTestScorer</tt> object, the client must 
provide to the <em>constructor</em>, via a <tt>String</tt> parameter, 
the answer key of the test.

</p><p>
<em>Observer</em> methods in the class answer such questions as
<ul>
  <li>How many students' tests have been scored so far?</li>
  <li>What raw score (number of questions answered correctly)
      was achieved by a particular student?</li>
  <li>What is the average of the students' raw scores?</li>
  <li>What is the standard deviation of the students' raw scores?</li>
  <li>How many students answered a particular question correctly?</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The lone <em>mutator</em> method is <tt>scoreTest()</tt>, and it
is the key to making objects of this class work correctly.
This method is responsible for scoring a test (the answers to which
are provided via a parameter) and for updating the 
<em>instance variables</em> appropriately.
(Note that all four instance variables are subject to change
each time <tt>scoreTest()</tt> is called.)


<hr>
<h3>An Example</h3>
</p><p>
To illustrate, suppose that the test being scored has as its answer 
key <tt>"bacad"</tt> and that the test papers of students named 
"Emily", "Jim", and "Diane" have been scored so far, on which their 
answers were <tt>"bbcad"</tt>, <tt>"adcbd"</tt>, and <tt>"bacad"</tt>,
respectively.  Then the object's instance constant/variables should be 
as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><td>
<pre>
    <b>stuIDs[]</b>      <b>rawScores[]</b>   <b>correctCount[]</b>    <b>ANSWER_KEY</b>
   +-------+         +---+          +---+         +-------+
 0 |"Emily"|       0 | 4 |        0 | 2 |         |"bacad"|
   +-------+         +---+          +---+         +-------+
 1 | "Jim" |       1 | 2 |        1 | 1 |
   +-------+         +---+          +---+      
 2 |"Diane"|       2 | 5 |        2 | 3 |      <b>numTestsScored</b>
   +-------+         +---+          +---+          +---+
 3 |   -   |       3 | - |        3 | 2 |          | 3 |
   +-------+         +---+          +---+          +---+
   |   .   |         | . |        4 | 3 |
   .   .   .         . . .          +---+
   .   .   .         . . . 
   .   .   .         . . . 
   |   .   |         | . |
   +-------+         +---+
19 |   -   |      19 | - |
   +-------+         +---+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p><p>
As the instance variables indicate, three tests have been scored so far,
submitted by students named Emily, Jim, and Diane, who achieved
raw scores 4, 2, and 5, respectively.
Also, the five questions on the test were answered correctly 
twice, once, thrice, twice, and thrice, respectively. 
Because only three tests have been scored, the values in array segment
<tt>rawScores[0..2]</tt> are of significance, but those in the rest
of the array <!-- (<tt>rawScores[3..rawScores.length-1]</tt>) -->
are irrelevant, as indicated by the dashes.  The same applies to the
<tt>stuIDs[]</tt> array.

</p><p>
Notice that elements of <tt>stuIDs[]</tt> and <tt>rawScores[]</tt> 
in corresponding locations are related to each other.
Specifically, for each relevant value of <tt>k</tt>, 
<tt>stuIDs[k]</tt> and <tt>rawScores[k]</tt> contain
values pertaining to the <tt>k</tt>-th test to be scored,
namely the ID of the student who took it and the raw score 
earned by that student, respectively.
For this reason, these arrays are informally said to be "parallel".
On the other hand, the <tt>correctCount[]</tt> array is parallel
to neither of the others, as the value stored in its location <tt>k</tt>
pertains not to the <tt>k</tt>-th test to be scored but rather to
question <tt>k</tt> on the test.



<hr>
<h3>Average and Standard Deviation</h3>

</p><p>
Two of the observers in the class are to return, respectively, the 
average (more precisely, the <em>arithmetic mean</em>) and the
<em>standard deviation</em> of the raw scores of the already-scored
tests.

</p><p>
Suppose that we have a collection of n numbers 
x<sub>0</sub>, x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n-1</sub>.
Then their average <tt>Avg</tt> (i.e., arithmetic mean)
is their sum divided by their number.  That is,

</p><p>
<center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x<sub>0</sub> + x<sub>1</sub> + ... + x<sub>n-1</sub><br />
Avg =  ------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n<br />
</center>

</p><p>
The same collection's <em>standard deviation</em> is the square root of

</p><p>
<center>
(x<sub>0</sub>&dash;Avg)<sup>2</sup> + 
(x<sub>1</sub>&dash;Avg)<sup>2</sup> + ... +
(x<sub>n-1</sub>&dash;Avg)<sup>2</sup><br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
n<br />
</center>

</p><p>
With respect to the example shown in the previous section (in which
three tests have been scored, with raw scores 4, 2, and 5), the 
values returned by the <tt>averageRawScore()</tt> and 
<tt>stdDevOfRawScores()</tt> methods should be something close 
to <tt>3.6667</tt> and <tt>1.247</tt>, respectively.

<hr>
<h3>Testing</h3>

</p><p>
For your convenience, the Java application <a href="MCTS_Tester.java">
<tt>MCTS_Tester</tt></a> is provided to you. 
It should serve well as a vehicle for testing your 
<tt>MultipleChoiceTestScorer</tt> class.
The output that it should produce is 
<a href="output.txt">here</a>.
Another good approach to testing would be to make use of jGrasp's
Workbench feature, as has been demonstrated in class several times.

<hr>
<h3>Program Submission</h3>
</p><p>
Submit your source code file (which <b>must be named</b>
<tt>MultipleChoiceTestScorer.java</tt>) from the course web page using the
<b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent to the link that
brought you to this page.
(Again, submit the <tt>.java</tt> file, <b>not</b> the
<tt>.class</tt> file.)
Make sure to include comments identifying yourself,
indicating that it is a solution to CMPS 134 Prog. Assg. #6,
acknowledging any persons who aided you in developing your solution,
and pointing out any flaws of which you are aware.

</p><p>
You may submit a program more than one time.  Hence, if, after
submitting, you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors),
you should submit the newer version.  However, all files submitted
should have the same name!
