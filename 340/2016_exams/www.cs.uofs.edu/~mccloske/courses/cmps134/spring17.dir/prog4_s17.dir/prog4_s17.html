<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
    Programming Assignment #4: Calendar Date Parser<br />
    Due: 11:59pm, Wednesday, April 5
</h2>

<h3>Background: Parsing (i.e., Syntactic Analysis)</h3>
</p><p>
You will recall from the previous programming assignment that
<em>lexical analysis</em> refers to the process of identifying, 
within a string of characters, its smallest meaningful component 
parts, called <em>lexemes</em>.  In that assignment, you developed
Java methods that identify, within a string representing a
calendar date, those substrings (i.e., component parts) 
that describe the year, month, and day. 

</p><p>
What usually follows lexical analysis is called <em>parsing</em> 
(or <em>syntactic analysis</em>), which refers to the process
of determining whether the sequence of lexemes produced during
lexical analysis makes any sense.  If not, the parser typically
produces messages that identify one or more errors.  
If so, the parser will, depending upon the application, 
translate the sequence of lexemes into a different, more useful,
form.<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>




<h3>Background: Calendar Dates</h3>
</p><p>
As you know from the previous programming assignment,
calendar dates are expressed in several different formats,
but they all convey the same three pieces of information: month,
day, and year.  Several formats in common use are listed in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_date">Wikipedia's
Calendar_date entry</a>.

</p><p>
This programming assignment extends what we did in the previous one, 
so we will be interested in the same four calendar date formats, 
which we illustrate here using examples:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
  <th>Format Name</th><th>Example 1</th><th>Example 2</th><th>Example 3</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>M/D/Y</td>
  <td><tt>11/29/2019</tt></td>
  <td><tt>2/5/1915</tt></td>
  <td><tt>7/4/576</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Y_MONTH_D</td>
  <td><tt>2013 SEPTEMBER 5</tt></td>
  <td><tt>55 March 15</tt></td><td><tt>1964 april 10</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Y-M-D</td>
  <td><tt>1974-04-08</tt></td>
  <td><tt>0002-05-23</tt></td>
  <td><tt>1678-12-19</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>DMonY</td>
  <td><tt>7DEC1954</tt></td>
  <td><tt>26Apr674</tt></td>
  <td><tt>12mAy1825</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Notice that, among the four formats of interest to us, only
Y-M-D requires all three components (year, month, and day) to
be expressed using fixed-length fields, including leading zeros
for padding if necessary.  (We will assume that only years in
the range 0..9999 are of interest to us, so that four digits
are always sufficient.)  The only other field of fixed length
is the month within the DMonY format, which has length three.
Also notice that, unlike in the previous assignment, we are 
considering month names and abbreviations to be 
<b>case insensitive</b>.  (In other words, the case of each
letter &mdash;upper or lower&mdash; doesn't matter.)

<h3>Requirements</h3>

</p><p>
In the previous programming assignment, you were to have completed
the development of a Java class, 
<a href="CalendarDateLexer.java">CalendarDateLexer</a>,
that included methods to "extract" the substrings representing
year, month, and day from calendar dates in each of the four formats.

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to finish the development of a Java class,
called <a href="CalendarDateParserZZ.java">CalendarDateParser</a>.
(Where code is missing or needs changing should be clear from embedded
comments.)
As its name suggests, its purpose is to act as a parser of calendar dates.
Specifically, it includes, for each of the four calendar date formats
of interest to us, a method that translates dates in that format into
<b>canonical</b> M/D/Y format.  (Here, "canonical" simply means that no
component has leading zeros.  For example, "5/8/2015" is in canonical M/D/Y
form but "05/08/2015" is not.)
Calendar dates that are syntactically or semantically 
invalid<sup><a href="#invalid">2</a></sup> are to be
translated into a special <tt>INVALID_DATE</tt> String (<tt>0/0/0</tt>), 
which is defined in the class.

</p><p>
The <tt>CalendarDateParser</tt> class makes use of the methods in the
<tt>CalendarDateLexer</tt> class, so you should use the link above to
download a correct version of the latter and place it into the same
folder as the former.

</p><p>
The four public methods in <tt>CalendarDateParser</tt> are named
<tt>translateFrom</tt><b>X</b><tt>()</tt>, where <b>X</b>
identifies one of the four calendar date formats of interest to us.
The <tt>translateFromMDY()</tt> method has been completed for you,
and you should use it as a model in completing the other three.

</p><p>
In addition to the four public methods are several private methods
that you should find very useful in implementing the public methods.
(By that we mean that each private method should be reached by some
chain of method calls originating at a public method.)
Some of the private methods are left for you to complete.  
It should come as no surprise to you that Java's if-else statement will
be useful in implementing several of the methods.

<h3>Testing Your Work</h3>
</p><p>
In order to make it convenient to test your work, provided is a
Java application program
<a href="CalendarDateParserTester.java">CalendarDateParserTester</a>
and an <a href="cal_dates.txt">accompanying data file</a>.
The program reads data from a file, under the assumption that 
each line of data contains a calendar date format identifier followed 
by (possibly) a calendar date in that format.
For each line of input data, the program echos the indicated
format and date, followed by its translation into canonical M/D/Y form.
(If the date is not valid, it translates to the invalid date string,
<tt>0/0/0</tt>.)
Of course, to carry out each translation, the appropriate method from 
the student's <tt>CalendarDateParser</tt> class is called.

</p><p>
To the right appears sample input data (as could appear in the
data file) and the output that the program should produce if
fed that input data.

</p><p>
Like the "tester" application provided for the previous programming assignment,
this one reads from the file whose name is provided via a command line argument
(or what jGrasp refers to as a "run argument").  If no argument is
provided, the program asks the user for the name of the input file.
<a href="../../jGrasp_run_arg.html">Here</a> are instructions for how to
pass run arguments to an application program in the jGrasp environment.

</p><p>
A sample input data file is provided, as indicated above.
But you are encouraged to make up your own input data, or to modify
that which was given.  A good choice of a text editor for this
purpose is the one provided by jGrasp.  To make a new file, 
click on <b>File</b>, then follow the path through <b>New</b>, 
</b>Other</b>, and <b>Plain Text</b>.

<hr>
<h3>Program Submission</h3>
Submit your source code file (<tt>CalendarDateParser.java</tt>) from
the course web page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent
to the link that brought you to this page.  (Again, submit <b>only</b>
the <tt>CalendarDateParser.java</tt> file, 
<b>not</b> the corresponding <tt>.class</tt> file and <b>not</b>
any other <tt>.java</tt> file.)
Make sure to augment the comments in the given program so that you
identify yourself, acknowledge any persons who aided you in developing
your solution, and point out any flaws that you know about.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit more than one time.  Hence, if, after
submitting, you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors),
you should submit the newer version.

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<a name="fn1">
[1] For example, a Java compiler's lexical analyzer produces a sequence
of lexemes corresponding to the key words, identifiers, literals,
curly braces, semicolons, etc., appearing in a Java class.
The compiler's parser then determines whether that sequence of lexemes
corresponds to a valid Java class.  If not, it produces error messages.
If so, it translates the sequence of lexemes into a form that is then 
further translated by the compiler's <em>code generator</em> into 
so-called <em>bytecode</em>, which is what is in a <tt>.class</tt> file.

</p><p>
<a name="invalid">
[2] The distinction between syntax errors and semantic errors is
somewhat fuzzy.  Rules of syntax impose restrictions upon the <b>form</b>
that an expression is allowed to take.  If an expression does not conform to
those rules, it is syntactically invalid.
Semantic rules, on the other hand, dictate the <b>meanings</b> of
(syntactically valid) expressions.  
An expression can be syntactically valid but yet meaningless (or ambiguous),
in which case we say that it is semantically invalid.
</p><p>
To give you a sense of what is meant by these terms in the context of 
calendar dates, consider the (purported) M/D/Y date <tt>9/37/2013</tt>.
If our rules of syntax say that any string composed of three positive
numerals separated by slashes is an M/D/Y date, then this string is 
syntactically valid.  However, it is semantically invalid,
because there is no such thing as September 37.

</p><p>
In contrast, the string <tt>937/2013</tt> is not a syntactically
valid M/D/Y date because it has only a single slash rather than two.
Likewise, <tt>abc//1978</tt> is syntactically invalid, because
even though it has exactly two slashes, <tt>abc</tt> is not a numeral,
nor is the empty string between the two slashes.

</p><p>
What about <tt>234/5/1978</tt>?  It is clearly invalid, but is the
error syntactic or semantic?  According to our earlier definition,
the error is not syntactic, because this string is composed of three
numerals separated by slashes.
But if we restrict our rules of syntax to say that an M/D/Y date
must be composed of a one- or two-digit numeral, followed by a slash,
followed by another one- or two-digit numeral, followed by a slash, 
followed by a one- to four-digit numeral, then the error is syntactic,
because <tt>234</tt> is not a one- or two-digit numeral.
