<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
Programming Assignment #1: <em>There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</em>
<br />
Due Time: 11:59pm, Thursday, Feb. 16
</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
</p><p>
You may be familiar with the nursery rhyme
<em>There was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly</em>, the lyrics of which,
like those of the song <em>The Twelve Days of Christmas</em>, 
are said to be "cumulative".

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to develop a Java application that
produces as output the lyrics of a somewhat modified version of
the rhyme, exactly as they are shown at the bottom of this document.
A <a href="LadySwallowedFlyZZ.java">skeleton</a> is provided for
you to get a start.

</p><p>
Your solution should show evidence that you generously employed the 
technique of procedural decomposition, which should help you to
obtain a program that is well-structured and in which there is very
little code redundancy.  
It is suggested that, for each verse, you introduce a method that prints it.
Try to avoid having two <tt>print</tt> (or <tt>println</tt>) statements
that print the same string.

<hr>
<h3>Submission of Program</h3>

Submit your source code file (which <b>must be named</b>
<b><tt>LadySwallowedFly.java</tt></b>) by clicking on the 
<b>Submit/Review</b> link (on the course web page)
that is adjacent to the link that brought you to this page.
<b>Do not</b> submit the associated <tt>.class</tt> file.

</p><p>
The skeleton that was provided to you (see link above) includes a 
comment describing the purpose/behavior of the program; a comment
identifying the course, semester, and assignment number; and comments 
intended to identify the program's author (you!) and those who helped
you to develop the program.  Also included is a comment intended for
you to describe any known deficiencies of your program.
Consider this to be a template that you are expected to follow in
all subsequent assignments.

<tr><td><pre>
There was an old lady who swallowed a fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a spider;
That wriggled and wiggled and tickled inside her!
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a bird;
How absurd to swallow a bird!
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cat;
Fancy that to swallow a cat!
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed an owl;
How will she ever empty her bowel?
She swallowed the owl to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed an eagle;
To her it tasted better than a beagle.
She swallowed the eagle to catch the owl,
She swallowed the owl to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a horse...
She's dead, of course!

  Verses left out (replaced by the owl and eagle verses!)

There was an old lady who swallowed a dog;
What a hog, to swallow a dog!
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a goat;
She just opened her throat and swallowed a goat!
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog,
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!

There was an old lady who swallowed a cow;
I don't know how she swallowed a cow!
She swallowed the cow to catch the goat
She swallowed the goat to catch the dog,
She swallowed the dog to catch the cat,
She swallowed the cat to catch the bird,
She swallowed the bird to catch the spider,
She swallowed the spider to catch the fly;
I don't know why she swallowed a fly - perhaps she'll die!
