<h2>CMPS 134 Spring 2017<br />
Test #1 (Section 31) Sample Solutions</h2>

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Correct answers were indicated on graded test papers.
</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(h)</b>, the nested loop iterates a total of 15
times (because it iterates three times during each of the five
iterations of the outer loop), and prints two *'s each time,
for a total of 30 *'s.

</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(i)</b>, the outer loop iterates with its control
variable <tt>j</tt> assuming the values 2,3,4,5, and 6.  
During each of those iterations, the nested loop iterates with its 
control variable <tt>k</tt> assuming values going from <tt>j</tt>'s 
current value up to and including 5.  This is depicted in the following
table.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpaddint="4">
<tr><th>Value of <tt>j</tt></th>
    <th>Values assumed by <tt>k</tt></th>
    <th># of iterations</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>2,3,4,5</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>3,4,5</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>4,5</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>5</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>none</td><td>0</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Adding up the values in the rightmost column yields the total number
of iterations of the nested loop.  That number is 10.
Because each such iteration prints a single *, 10 is the number 
of *'s that are printed.

</p><p>
Regarding part <b>(j)</b>, the outer loop iterates with its control
variable <tt>i</tt> assuming the values 5,3, and 1.  
During each of those iterations, the nested loop iterates with its 
control variable <tt>j</tt> assuming values going from 1 up to
and including <tt>i</tt>'s current value.
This is depicted in the following table.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpaddint="4">
<tr><th>Value of <tt>i</tt></th>
    <th>Values assumed by <tt>j</tt></th>
    <th># of iterations</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1,2,3,4,5</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>1,2,3</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Adding up the values in the rightmost column yields the total number
of iterations of the nested loop.  That number is 9.
Because each such iteration prints a single *, 9 is the number 
of *'s that are printed.
