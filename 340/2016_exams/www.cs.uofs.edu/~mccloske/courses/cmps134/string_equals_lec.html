    Java Programming Exercise: Comparing Strings for Equality
</h2>


</p><p>
Here we consider the problem of determining whether or not two
<tt>String</tt> objects are equal.

</p><p>
The <tt>java.lang.String</tt> class includes a method
(namely, <tt>equals()</tt>) by which to test whether two instances of
the <tt>String</tt> class are equal to each other, meaning that they 
represent the same sequence of <b><tt>char</tt></b>acters.

</p><p>
As an academic exercise, let's develop our own method to do the same job.
Here is the specification:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2)</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 1</b></center>

</p><p>
What, exactly, does it mean for two Strings to be equal?  
Well, in the first place it requires that their lengths be equal.
If that condition is not met, we can immediately conclude that
the strings are not equal.  If, on the other hand, their lengths 
are equal, more work is necessary to arrive at an answer.
This suggests a solution of the following form:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2)
{
   boolean result;
   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
      result = false;
   }
   else {
      // s1 and s2 have same length, so do whatever is necessary to 
      // determine if they are equal and assign appropriate value to 'result'
   }
   return result;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 2</b></center>

</p><p>
Notice that the code above conforms to a standard template that is often
used in <em>functional</em> methods (i.e., methods that return a value),
which is to have a local variable, often called <tt>result</tt>, the
purpose of which is to have the method's return-value assigned to it 
somewhere in the body of the method, and then, in the last line of the
body of the method, to have its value <b><tt>return</tt></b>ed.
Such a variable could reasonably be called the method's 
<em>result-variable</em>.

</p><p>
Using <tt>result</tt> as the name of a method's result-variable is
appropriate, given that that name is suggestive of the variable's 
purpose, but often one can devise a name that is more descriptive
of the variable's meaning, and hence is a better choice.

</p><p>
Now we focus on the case when the two Strings have the same length.
As an example, consider the (unequal) Strings <b><tt>CATTLE</tt></b> 
and <b><tt>CASTLE</tt></b>.  
(Attach no significance to the fact that the examples used here make use
of upper case letters; it is simply to make them stand out more.)

</p><p>
What makes them unequal?<br />
<b>Answer:</b> They disagree in the 2nd position, where one has a 
<b><tt>T</tt></b> and the other has an <b><tt>S</tt></b>.
(Recall that we number the positions in a String beginning with zero,
not one.)

</p><p>
The Strings <b><tt>GARBAGE</tt></b> and <b><tt>BABBLES</tt></b> are unequal
as well, as they disagree in several positions (0th, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 6th).

</p><p>
The point is that if two Strings of equal length disagree in 
one or more positions, they are unequal.
If they disagree nowhere, they are equal.

</p><p>
Based upon this analysis, we design our method to have a loop that 
iterates through the positions of the two Strings, comparing the 
pair of characters occurring at each position.
If and when a disagreement is observed, we "remember" it by setting the
method's return-variable to <b>false</b>.
If no disagreement is found, the loop will terminate having found
the two Strings to be in agreement at every position.

</p><p>
Given this approach, it would seem reasonable to call the method's 
return-variable <tt>equalSoFar</tt>, suggesting that its value 
corresponds to the truth-value of the statement "no disagreement
(between the two Strings) has been observed so far".

</p><p>
If no disagreement is ever found, <b>false</b> will never be assigned
to <tt>equalSoFAr</tt>, and so the value assigned to it originally 
will be returned.  Ah, so that means that we need to initialize it to
<b>true</b>.  Here is our completed solution: 

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2)
{
   boolean equalSoFar = true; 

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
      equalSoFar = false;
   }
   else {
      for (int i=0; i != s1.length(); i = i+1) {
         if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
            equalSoFar = false;
         }
      }
   }
   return equalSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 3</b></center>

</p><p>
Notice that the <b>if</b> statement inside the <b>for-loop</b> has no
<b>else</b> part.  A common mistake made by novice programmers
when asked to develop this method is to include an <b>else</b> part 
and to put in it the assignment <tt>equalSoFar = true</tt>.  
Why is this a mistake?
<b>Answer:</b> Because then, in the case that <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>
have equal lengths, the final value of <tt>equalSoFar</tt> depends 
exclusively upon the last iteration of the loop, during which it will be
set to either <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> according to whether or not 
the characters in the last position of <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are 
the same.  
Hence, the result returned by the method will not answer the question of
whether or not <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are equal but rather whether
or not their lengths are the same and their last characters are equal.
(For example, the Strings <b><tt>LARK</tt></b> and <b><tt>BUNK</tt></b>
would be reported to be equal, simply because they have the same length
and end with the same character!)

</p><p>
Ahh, but this bit of reasoning should make it clear to the reader,
if it wasn't clear already, that <tt>equalSoFar</tt> should <b>never</b>
have its value changed from <b>false</b> to <b>true</b>.  Indeed, its
value will become <b>false</b> only if some disagreement between
<tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> is observed, and changing its value back to
<b>true</b> would be, in effect, "forgetting" that such an observation 
had been made, possibly leading to reporting a "false positive", as in
the <tt>LARK</tt> vs. <tt>BUNK</tt> example just mentioned.

</p><p>
So if the value of <tt>equalSoFar</tt> is to remain <b>false</b> if
ever it assumes that value (leading eventually to the method returning
that value), then the method ought to cease its work as soon as such an
event occurs!  In other words, if a disagreement between <tt>s1</tt> and
<tt>s2</tt> is observed in some particular position, there is no point
in comparing the characters that occur in subsequent positions of the
Strings and hence the loop should terminate without iterating again.

</p><p>
To effect this change, we augment the loop guard by adding
<tt>equalSoFar</tt> as a new conjunct.  (Note that the value of the
expression <tt>equalSoFar</tt> is necessarily equal to the value of
the expression <tt>equalSoFar == true</tt>, so there is no point in
using the latter, which is unnecessarily verbose.
Many novice programmers cannot seem to absorb this fact, however.)  
Here is the updated method, with the modification in 
<font color="red">red</font>:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   boolean equalSoFar = true;

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { 
      equalSoFar = false;
   }
   else {
      for (int i=0; i != s1.length() <font color="red">&amp;&amp; equalSoFar</font>; i = i+1)
      {
         if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) { 
            equalSoFar = false;
         }
      }
   }
   return equalSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 4</b></center>

</p><p>
But what appears in Version 4 is an improper use of a <b>for-loop</b>,
at least according to some "programming purists".
Why?  Because, they would say, a <b>for-loop</b>'s guard should depend 
entirely upon the loop control variable's value in relation to the 
range of values over which it is intended to iterate.
Here the guard depends not only upon that range but also upon the value of
<tt>equalSoFar</tt>.
The more appropriate loop construct to use in this case is the
<b>while-loop</b>.  Making this change, we get

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   boolean equalSoFar = true;

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { 
      equalSoFar = false;
   }
   else {
      <font color="red">int i = 0;
      while</font> (i != s1.length() &amp;&amp; equalSoFar)
      {
         if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) { 
            equalSoFar = false;
         }
         <font color="red">i = i+1;</font>
      }
   }
   return equalSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 5</b></center>

</p><p>
Observe that in Version 5 the loop will terminate either because 
<tt>equalSoFar</tt> has been set to <tt>false</tt> (because a 
disagreement has been found) or <tt>i</tt>'s value has reached 
<tt>s1.length()</tt>, or both.
By introducing an <b>else-part</b> and placing the increment of <tt>i</tt>
into it, we make it impossible for both of these conditions to hold:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   boolean equalSoFar = true;

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { 
      equalSoFar = false;
   }
   else {
      int i = 0;
      while (i != s1.length() &amp;&amp; equalSoFar)
      {
         if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) 
            { equalSoFar = false; }
         <font color="red">else
            { i = i+1; }</font>
      }
   }
   return equalSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 6</b></center>

</p><p>
The modification made to arrive at Version 6 is useful only in that it
is going to help us transition more smoothly to a superior Version 7.
Specifically, we observe that the loop in Version 6 will terminate with 
<tt>i == s1.length()</tt> if, and only if, <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>
are equal.  (After all, had a disagreement been found, the loop would have
terminated with <tt>i</tt> indicating the position of that disagreement,
somewhere in the range <tt>0..s1.length()-1</tt>.)

</p><p>
This observation leads us to realize that we don't need to make use
of <tt>equalSoFar</tt> inside the loop, nor do we need the 
<b>if</b>-statement there.  Rather, all the loop needs to
do is to keep incrementing <tt>i</tt> until either <tt>i</tt> "falls off" 
the ends of the Strings (by becoming equal to <tt>s1.length()</tt>)
or a disagreement is found between the characters at position <tt>i</tt>
of <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt>.
When the loop terminates, we can determine which of those two
events occurred by comparing <tt>i</tt> with <tt>s1.length()</tt>
and assigning the result to <tt>equalSoFar</tt>.
Based upon these observations, we refine the method to obtain Version 7:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   boolean equalSoFar = true;

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { 
      equalSoFar = false;
   }
   else {
      int i = 0;
      <font color="red">while (i != s1.length()  &amp;&amp;  s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(i)) {
         i = i+1;
      }
      //assertion: i == s1.length iff s1 and s2 are equal
      equalSoFar = (i == s1.length());</font>
   }
   return equalSoFar;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 7</b></center>

</p><p>
Novice programmers tend to be confused by an assignment such as
<tt>equalSoFar = (i == s1.length())</tt>, but there is really nothing 
complicated about it.  As with any assignment statement, the expression
on the right-hand side is evaluated and the result is stored in the
variable indicated on the left-hand side.  Here the expression and the
variable are of type <tt>boolean</tt>, that's all.  Indeed, this 
statement is equivalent to the following (verbose in comparison)
<b>if-else</b> statement:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>if (i == s1.length())
   { equalSoFar = true; }
else
   { equalSoFar = false; }</pre>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Another point of concern in the code of Version 7 is the loop guard.
Won't its evaluation in the case that <tt>i == s1.length()</tt> result
in a <tt>StringIndexOutOfBounds</tt> exception being thrown
as a result of trying to access the character at (nonexistent)
position <tt>s1.length()</tt> of <tt>s1</tt>?  
<b>Answer: No</b>.  Why not?  Because in Java, conjunctions are evaluated
in a "short circuit" fashion.  That is, when a conjunction <tt>P &amp;&amp; Q</tt>
is evaluated, <tt>P</tt> is evaluated first and, if found to be <b>false</b>,
<tt>Q</tt> is ignored.  In other words, <tt>Q</tt> will be evaluated only after
&mdash;and if&mdash; <tt>P</tt> has been found to be <b>true</b>.

</p><p>
Now, the convention of making use of a result-variable is just that, a 
convention and not a requirement.  Some programmers would argue that the
next version of our method, which is like Version 7 but with
<tt>equalSoFar</tt> (the result-variable) removed, is an improvement.

<a name="Version8"></a>
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { 
      return false;
   }
   else {
      int i = 0;
      while (i != s1.length()  &amp;&amp;  s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(i)) {
         i = i+1;
      }
      //assertion: i == s1.length iff s1 and s2 are equal
      return i == s1.length();
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 8</b></center>

</p><p>
There are some purists, however, who would criticize Version 8 
for failing to adhere to the <b>single entry &ndash; single exit</b>
doctrine of <b>structured programming</b>, which says that every 
"block" of code (which includes any loop-statement, if-statement,
or method body) should have a single entry point (at the "top") 
and a single exit point (at the "bottom"). 
Version 8 of our method has two exit points corresponding 
to the pair of <tt>return</tt> statements.

</p><p>
An even more egregious violation of this doctrine can be observed in
Version 9:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   if (s1.length() != s2.length()) { return false; }

   // If execution reaches here, the lengths of s1 and s2 are the same.
   for (int i=0; i != s1.length(); i = i+1)
   {
      if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) { return false; }
   }
   // If execution reaches here, no disagreements were found.
   return true;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 9</b></center>

</p><p>
In this author's opinion, Version 8 is acceptable, but Version 9
goes too far in its failure to adhere to the Structured Programming
doctrine.


<hr>
<h3>Appendix</h3>
</p><p>
Here we consider whether or not it is really necessary to treat the 
case in which the lengths of <tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are
different separately from the case in which their lengths are equal.
How would our Version 8 method behave if, say, we got rid of the
<b>if-statement</b>, keeping only the <b>while-loop</b> nested in its
<b>else-branch</b>?  The method would be as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<font color="red">WARNING: This solution is incorrect</font><br />
<pre>/* Returns true if the two specified Strings are equal, false otherwise
*/
public static boolean strEqual(String s1, String s2) {

   int i = 0;
   while (i != s1.length()  &amp;&amp;  s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(i)) {
      i = i+1;
   }
   //assertion: i == s1.length iff s1 and s2 are equal
   return i == s1.length();
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
<center><b>Version 8'</b></center>

</p><p>
Consider what would happen if the caller passed the Strings 
<b><tt>CAT</tt></b> and <b><tt>CATTLE</tt></b>, respectively,
to the Version 8' method.
After three loop iterations, the loop would terminate having found
no disagreements, due to the fact that <b><tt>CAT</tt></b>
(the value of <tt>s1</tt>) is a prefix of <b><tt>CATTLE</tt></b>
(the value of <tt>s2</tt>).  Then the method would return
the value <tt>true</tt>, incorrectly informing the caller that
<b><tt>CAT</tt></b> and <b><tt>CATTLE</tt></b> are equal!  
In effect, the method would yield a "false positive".

</p><p>
Now consider what would happen if the caller passed <b><tt>CATTLE</tt></b> 
and <b><tt>CAT</tt></b> to the method, respectively.  
On the 4th iteration of the loop (after the first three iterations 
had found no disagreements in postions 0..2), an attempt would be made 
to compare the characters at position 3 of the two Strings.
<b>But there is no position 3</b> in <b><tt>CAT</tt></b>, and so an 
exception will be thrown, causing the program to abort.
The general rule is this: if <tt>s</tt> is of type <tt>String</tt>,
the method call <tt>s.charAt(E)</tt> will result in an
<tt>IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt> being thrown if <tt>E</tt>'s value
is not in the range <tt>0..s.length()-1</tt>.  This makes perfect sense,
as the only positions that exist within a String are the ones in that
range.

</p><p>
Our conclusion is that yes, the case in which the lengths of 
<tt>s1</tt> and <tt>s2</tt> are different needs to be handled
separately from the other case.
