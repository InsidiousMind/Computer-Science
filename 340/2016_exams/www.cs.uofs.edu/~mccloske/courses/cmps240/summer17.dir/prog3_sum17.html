<h2>
  CMPS 240 &nbsp; Summer 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #3: Intervals<br />
  Due: August 7
</h2>

<!-- <h2>Background</h2> -->

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java
class <a href="../summer12.dir/prog4_intervals.dir/IntervalZZ.java">Interval</a>.
Each instance of this class represents an interval over the real numbers.
For example, the interval <tt>[4.3, 8.5]</tt> is the set of all 
real numbers <tt>x</tt> satisfying <tt>4.3 &le; x &le; 8.5</tt>.

</p><p>
Most of the class's methods are only stubs and are clearly marked as such.
A few methods are provided in full.

</p><p>
The simple nature of the subject matter of this assignment (intervals),
together with the detailed method specifications present in the source
code provided to you, make it unnecessary to provide any further
explanation here.

</p><p>
For the purposes of testing your work, you are encouraged to make use of 
the Java application 
<a href="../summer12.dir/prog4_intervals.dir/IntervalApp.java">IntervalApp</a>.
