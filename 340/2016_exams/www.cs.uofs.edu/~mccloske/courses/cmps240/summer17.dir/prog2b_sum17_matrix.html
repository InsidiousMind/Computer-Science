<h2>
  CMPS 240  Summer 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #2b: Implementing a Two-dimensional Matrix via 
    an Array<br />
  Due: August 1
</h2>
</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java 
class 
<a href="../summer12.dir/prog2_matrix_via_array.dir/TwoDimMatrixViaArrayZZ.java">
TwoDimMatrixViaArray</a>, 
which implements the Java interface 
<a href="../summer12.dir/prog2_matrix_via_array.dir/TwoDimMatrix.java">TwoDimMatrix</a>.

</p><p>
As its name suggests, an instance of a class that implements the
<tt>TwoDimMatrix</tt> interface is intended to represent a
two-dimensional matrix.
Note that the interface has a generic type parameter; the intent is
that an implementing class will have a corresponding parameter
having as its purpose to provide the client with the freedom to choose,
when a matrix is created, the data type of the values that may occupy 
the cells in the matrix.

</p><p>
By examining the comments describing the first constructor of the class
<tt>TwoDimMatrixViaArray</tt>, it should be clear that the intent
&mdash;similar to that in the previous programming assignment&mdash;
is to allow the client to choose the row and column index ranges.
Hence, for example, a client can create a 4&times;3 matrix where the
rows are numbered -2 through 1 and the columns are numbered 10 through 12.

</p><p>
From the name of the class, it should be clear that the intent is
for the values logically occupying the matrix to be stored,
physically, in a one-dimensional array.

</p><p>
Hence, the central problem for the programmer is to figure out how
to map a two-dimensional matrix index <tt>(i,j)</tt> into the
corresponding array index <tt>k</tt>.  In class, we noted that,
for the example of a two-dimensional matrix with row index range
<tt>0..M-1</tt> and column index range <tt>0..N-1</tt>, one 
suitable mapping is <tt>(i,j) &rarr; i&times;N + j</tt>.
(This mapping corresponds to what's called <b>row-major ordering</b>,
in which the matrix's values are stored in the array one row after
another.)

</p><p>
Because we are allowing the row and column index ranges to begin
at non-zero values, the mapping function will be a little more
complicated.  (Of course, this function should be implemented
in the form of a private method that is invoked from both the
<tt>get()</tt> and <tt>put()</tt> methods.)

</p><p>
Note that <tt>IndexOutOfBoundsException</tt> is defined in
the package <tt>java.lang</tt>.

</p><p>
An application that can be used for testing is

TwoDimMatrixViaArrayTester</a>.
