<h2>CMPS 240 &nbsp; Summer 2017<br />
Programming Assignment #1: Unbounded Natural Numbers
</h2>

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the Java class
<a href="NaturalNumber1ZZ.java">NaturalNumber1</a>, which is a subclass
of the abstract class <a href="NaturalNumberZZ.java">NaturalNumber</a>.
Notice that some of the methods in the latter are complete.
Incomplete public methods in the former are indicated by the comment 
<tt>STUB!!</tt>.

</p><p>
You may wish to add private methods to <tt>NaturalNumber1</tt>
and you will certainly have to add declarations of instance variables
there.

</p><p>
Perhaps the most "natural" way to represent a natural number is using
an array <tt>digits[]</tt> of <tt>byte</tt> values, where each element 
in the array stores one digit of the number.  For example, an object
representing the natural number <tt>8403426</tt> could have a state
that "looks" like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="3">
<tr><td>
<pre>         0   1   2   3   4   5   6
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
digits | 6 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 0 | 4 | 8 |
       +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The digit values are stored in the array from least to most significant
because it simplifies the implementation of the relevant algorithms.
(Using elements of type <tt>byte</tt> was suggested because each one
occupies only a single byte of memory rather than four, as do values
of type <tt>int</tt>.)

</p><p>
Now, this example assumes a representation based upon the 
decimal (i.e., base 10) numeral system.  More efficient would be
to use base 256, as each element of the array (assuming elements of
type <tt>byte</tt>) can store any value in the range 0..255 and
thus a large number N could be stored using only 
&lfloor;log<sub>256</sub> N&rfloor; + 1 elements rather than
&lfloor;log<sub>10</sub> N&rfloor; + 1 elements, the latter of 
which is a little more than twice as many.

For testing purposes, you may wish to make use of the 
<a href="NaturalNumCalculator.java">NaturalNumCalculator</a>
and
<a href="NaturalNumber1Tester.java">NaturalNumber1Tester</a>
classes:
