<h2>Background</h2>

</p><p>
In a previous assignment, you dealt with the concept of an interval of
real numbers, leading to the development of a class called
<b><tt>Interval</tt></b>.  An interval is characterized by two real
numbers, namely a lower bound and an upper bound, and represents the
set of all real numbers that fall between them.

</p><p>
Here we explore this concept further by considering a larger variety
of sets of real numbers, namely those that can be described as the
union of finitely many intervals.  We refer to such a set as a
UFI-set.  For example,

</p><p>
<center><tt>
[-3, 6] &cup; [12,25] &cup; [37,38] &cup; [83, 105]
</tt></center>

</p><p>
is a UFI-set.
It should be obvious that any UFI-set can be described by a list of
intervals in which each one's upper bound is less than that of the
next one's lower bound, such as we have done in the example above.

</p><p>
Among the kinds of queries we may want to make about a UFI-set <tt>S</tt>
are the obvious ones: 
<ul>
  <li>Given real number <tt>x</tt>, "Does <tt>S</tt> contain <tt>x</tt>?"
      (I.e., Is <tt>x</tt> a member of <tt>S</tt>?)
  </li>
  <li>Given an interval <tt>I = [x,y]</tt>,
      "Does <tt>S</tt> contain <tt>I</tt>?"
      (I.e., Is <tt>I</tt> a subset of <tt>S</tt>?)
  </li>
  <li>Given a UFI-set <tt>R</tt>, "Does <tt>S</tt> contain <tt>R</tt>?"
      (I.e., Is <tt>R</tt> a subset of <tt>S</tt>?)
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The alert reader will notice that each of the first two kinds of queries
is a special case of the one following it.  (A real number <tt>x</tt>
corresponds to the length-zero interval <tt>[x,x]</tt> and the interval
<tt>[x,y]</tt> is itself a UFI-set (that is the union of one interval).

</p><p>
In what other kinds of operations might a UFI-set participate?
Among these are the usual "set-theoretic" operations:
Given two UFI-sets <tt>R</tt> and <tt>S</tt>, compute
<tt>R &cup; S</tt> (their union),
<tt>R &cap; S</tt> (their intersection), or
<tt>R - S</tt> (their difference).
Note that each of these is itself a UFI-set!

</p><p>
Not surprisingly, each of the set-theoretic operations mentioned above
(union, intersection, and difference applied to two UFI-sets)
can be expressed in terms of analogous operations involving a UFI-set
and a single interval.
Let each of <tt>R<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>R<sub>2</sub></tt>, ..., and
<tt>R<sub>m</sub></tt> be mutually disjoint intervals, and similarly for
<tt>S<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>S<sub>2</sub></tt>, ..., and
<tt>S<sub>n</sub></tt>
Let <tt>R = &cup;R<sub>1&le;i&le;m</sub></tt> and
<tt>S = &cup;S<sub>1&le;i&le;m</sub></tt>,
so that each of <tt>R</tt> and <tt>S</tt> is a UFI-set.
Then
</p><p>
<tt>R &cup; S = (...((R &cup; S<sub>1</sub>) &cup; S<sub>2</sub>) ...) &cup; 
                S<sub>n</sub></tt> 
</p><p>
<tt>R &cap; S = &cup;<sub>1&le;i&le;m,1&le;j&le;n</sub>
and

 be mutually disjoint intervals, and similarly for

, <tt>R<sub>2</sub></tt>, ...,
Letting UFI-sets <tt>R</tt> and <tt>S</tt> be

For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java
classes <a href="SetOfDisjointIntervalsAbstractZZ.java">
SetOfDisjointIntervalsAbstract</a> and 
<a href="SetOfDisjointIntervalsViaArrayListZZ.java">
SetOfDisjointIntervalsViaArrayList</a>.

.  Each instance of this
class represents an interval over the real numbers.
For example, the interval <tt>[4.3, 8.5]</tt> is the set of all 
real numbers <tt>x</tt> satisfying <tt>4.3 &le; x &le; 8.5</tt>.

</p><p>
Most of the class's methods are only stubs and are clearly marked as such.
A few methods are provided in full.

</p><p>
The simple nature of the subject matter of this assignment (intervals),
together with the detailed method specifications present in the source
code provided to you, make it unnecessary to provide any further
explanation here.

</p><p>
For the purposes of testing your work, you are encouraged to make use of 
the Java application <a href="IntervalApp.java">IntervalApp</a>.
