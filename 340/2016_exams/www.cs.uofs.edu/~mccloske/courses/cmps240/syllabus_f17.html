<b>Textbook:</b>&nbsp;  
  <em>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</em> (6th edition)
  by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser, published by Wiley, 2014.
  (ISBN-13: 978-1118771334, ISBN-10: 1118771338)
<br />

<p>
<b>Exams and quizzes:</b>&nbsp;
   Expect a quiz (taking about fifteen minutes) once every week or two.
   Expect a one hour exam in late September and another one in early
   November.
   The comprehensive (two-hour) final exam will be sometime during 
   "Final Exam Week", which is December ??-??.
   <!--Exams are "open book", which is to say that you may refer to the
   textbook, class notes, graded programs, etc., during the exam.
   -->
   (Makeup exams will be offered only if circumstances warrant it,
   such as in the case of an emergency or sudden illness.)
</p><p>
<b>Programming Assignments:</b>&nbsp;
   </p><p>
   There will be approximately eight to ten programming assignments.
   Grades will be based upon not only correctness and efficiency 
   but also on subjective attributes such as quality of documentation,
   proper code formatting, and readability.
   </p><p>
   Submitted solutions must include comments that identify the student(s)
   submitting it (e.g., <tt>Chris Smith</tt>), the course and semester
   (in this case, <tt> CMPS 240, Fall 2017</tt>), the assignment
   number (e.g., <tt>Prog. Assg. #2</tt>),
   and a list of names of any persons who provided assistance in
   completing the work.
   They should also include comments that point out any known flaws in
   the work.
   </p><p>
   Work submitted after the deadline is subject to a penalty of ten percent
   per day.  As a general rule, work cannot be submitted more than 72 hours
   past the time that it is due.
   </p><p>
   Students are allowed to collaborate with each other while working
   on assignments, <b>but such collaboration is to be acknowledged, in
   writing, within the submitted work</b>, as mentioned above.
   Collaboration should not go so far that it becomes untruthful for a
   student to claim that submitted work is, for the most part, his or 
   her own (or that of his/her team, in the case of a team project).
   Under no circumstances is a student to copy the work of another or
   to allow another student to copy her/his work.

<b>Grading:</b>
   <p>
   Approximate weights:
   <font face="Courier New,Courier">
   <pre>
       Semester exams and quizzes: 36%
       Final exam:                 24%
       Programs/Homework :         36%
       Class Participation:         4%

   Mapping from numerical average to letter grade (approximate):
   <font face="Courier New,Courier">
   <pre>
        [94,100] --- A           [75, 79) --- C+
        [90, 94) --- A-          [71, 75) --- C
        [86, 90) --- B+          [68, 71) --- C-
        [82, 86) --- B           [63, 68) --- D+
        [79, 82) --- B-          [58, 63) --- D

<b>Intended Course Outcomes</b>
</p><p>
Upon completion of the course, a successful student will 
<!-- have the ability to do each of the following -->
<ul>
  <li>be capable of developing object-oriented software that makes
      proper use of generics, inheritance, and polymorphism.
  </li>
  <li>appreciate the utility of, and know when to use, 
      several standard abstract data types,
      including stacks, queues, lists, trees, and graphs.
  </li>
  <li>be capable of devising interfaces and implementations of
      abstract data types appropriate for solving a given problem.
  </li>
  <li>be capable of analyzing a program (involving loops and/or
      recursion) in order to determine its asymptotic running time 
      and space usage.
  </li>
  <li>fully comprehend several classic algorithms, including ones
      for searching, sorting, data compression, and traversing graphs.
  </li>
</ul>
