  CMPS 240  Fall 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #1: Freeing Java Arrays from the [0,N) 
  Index Range Straitjacket<br />
  Due: Noon, Monday August 28
</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java class 
<a href="DynAnchArrayZZ.java">DynAnchArray</a>
(an abbreviation for "Dynamically Anchored Array"),
whose instances have essentially the same functionality as (one-dimensional)
arrays (even if the syntax for accessing their elements more closely resembles
that of <tt>ArrayList</tt>s), except that their index ranges are specified, at
construction time, by the client.  (In Java, every array's index range begins
at zero, which can be an inconvenience.)

</p><p>
Each method that needs to be completed is identified by the comment
<tt>// STUB!!</tt>.

</p><p>
For your convenience, the Java application
<a href="DynAnchArrayTester.java">DynAnchArrayTester</a>
is provided to you.  In order to make fruitful use of it,
you must pass to it a sequence of <b>command line arguments</b>
(or what jGrasp calls "run arguments").
How to do this when running a program in jGrasp is explained 
<a href="../../../com_line_args_jGrasp.html">here</a>.

</p><p>
What <tt>DynAnchArrayTester</tt> does is to place whatever
command line arguments are provided to it into an instance of
the <tt>DynAnchArray</tt> class, in a pseudo-random order.
(The bottom of the index range is also chosen pseudo-randomly.)
Then it displays the contents of that object two times, 
once using its <tt>toString()</tt> method and once using an 
Iterator.

<table border="2" cellpadding="4" align="right" >
<tr><td>
<pre>

% <b>java DynAnchArrayTester Kirk Spock Uhura McCoy Scott Sulu</b>
Contents of a DynAnchArray as provided by its toString() method:

-2: Spock
-1: Uhura
0: Sulu
1: Kirk
2: McCoy
3: Scott

Contents of DynAnchArray as provided by an Iterator:

Spock
Uhura
Sulu
Kirk
McCoy
Scott

Goodbye.</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p><p>
To illustrate, on the right is shown an invocation of
<tt>DynAnchArrayTester</tt> from the command line in a UNIX environment
(shown in boldface) and the output that results.

</p><p>
In case you are not familiar with some of the features of Java that
are to be used in this assignment (e.g., generics, nested classes, 
iterators), provided to you is this sample Java class:
<a href="StackViaAryBounded.java">StackViaAryBounded</a>.

<h3>Program Submission</h3>

Submit your source code file (<tt>DynAnchArray.java</tt>) from the course web
page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent to the link that 
brought you to this page. (Again, submit <b>only</b> your
<tt>DynAnchArray.java</tt> file, not the corresponding <tt>.class</tt> file 
nor any other file.) 

</p><p>
Make sure to augment the comments near the top of the class so that you 
identify yourself, acknowledge any persons who aided you in developing your 
solution, and point out any flaws that you know about.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit more than one time. Hence, if, after submitting,
you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors), you should submit 
the newer version.  Every submitted file should have the same name,
namely <tt>DynAnchArray.java</tt>!

</p><p>
After submitting a file, you can verify that it was copied into the proper
folder by "reviewing" it.  Just refresh the "Submit Page" and links to
all files that you have submitted will appear under your name near the
top left of the page.   Note that when a file with the same name as a
previously-submitted file is submitted, the older file is renamed so
that a time stamp is in its name.
