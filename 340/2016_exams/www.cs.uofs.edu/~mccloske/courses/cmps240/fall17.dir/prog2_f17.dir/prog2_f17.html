  CMPS 240  Fall 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #2: Same Difference<br />
  Due: Noon, Thursday September 7
</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

</p><p>
For this assignment, you are to complete the development of the Java class
<a href="SameDifferenceZZ.java"><tt>SameDifference</tt></a>.
Its two static public methods 
&mdash;<tt>findPairs()</tt> and <tt>findPairsDefensive()</tt>&mdash;
serve the same purpose, which is to return an <tt>ArrayList</tt> 
(i.e., an instance of the class
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html"
 target="_blank">
<tt>java.util.ArrayList</tt></a>) containing all pairs (i,j) 
(i.e., instances of the class
<a href="PairOfInts.java"><tt>PairOfInts</tt></a>)
satisfying the property that subtracting the j-th element of the
second of two given arrays from the i-th element of the first array
yields a specified "delta" value.

</p><p>
The two methods differ only in that one assumes as a precondition
that both arrays passed to it contain elements that are in increasing
order while the other method explicitly tests that condition 
and throws an exception if it is not satisfied.  (The latter of
the two methods exemplifies a <em>defensive</em> programming
approach.)  Of course, in addition to completing the two
public methods, you are free to add private methods that
play a supporting role.

</p><p>
To illustrate the idea, suppose that the two arrays of interest
are as illustrated below and the delta value is 4.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>     0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
a | -1 |  2 |  5 |  6 | 12 | 15 | 20 | 21 | 29 |
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

     0   1    2    3     4    5    6    7    8    9   10
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
b | -4 | -1 |  2 |  3 |  5 |  8 | 14 | 18 | 20 | 22 | 25 |
  +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
There are three pairs (i,j) of locations that satisfy the
condition <tt>a[i] - b[j] = delta = 4</tt>, and they are
(3,2), (4,5), and (8,10).

</p><p>
For your convenience, the Java application
<a href="SameDifferenceTester.java">SameDifferenceTester</a>
is provided to you.  In order to make fruitful use of it,
you must pass to it three <b>command-line arguments</b>
(or what jGrasp calls "run arguments").
the first two of which indicate the lengths of the two arrays
to be compared and the third of which indicates the desired 
"delta" value.
How to supply command-line arguments when running a program in jGrasp
is explained <a href="../../../com_line_args_jGrasp.html">here</a>.

</p><p>
What <tt>SameDifferenceTester</tt> does is to create two arrays
of the lengths indicated by the first two command-line arguments,
populates them with pseudo-randomly chosen values 
(but ensuring that each array's elements are in increasing order), 
calls the <tt>findPairs()</tt> method (passing to it as parameters the 
arrays and the delta value indicated by the third command-line argument), 
and prints the pairs that occupy the <tt>ArrayList</tt> returned by the
method.
Any "false positives" (i.e., pairs that are in the returned
<tt>ArrayList</tt> but that should not be) are identified as such.
"False negatives" (i.e., pairs that do not appear in the
returned <tt>ArrayList</tt> but should be there) are not identified.
In this respect, this "tester application" is somewhat lacking.

</p><p>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4" align="right" >
<tr><td>
<pre><b>% java SameDifferenceTester 10 15 3</b>
First array:
  [-1, 4, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19]
Second array:
  [0, 4, 7, 10, 15, 18, 23, 25, 28, 33, 37, 42, 44, 49, 52]

Pairs of locations whose elements differ by 3:
(2,1)
(5,3)
(8,4)</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>

</p><p>
To illustrate, on the right is shown an invocation of
<tt>DifferenceTester</tt> from the command line in a UNIX environment
(shown in boldface) and the output that results.

<h3>Note</h3>
</p><p>
Remember that this is a course about data structures and algorithms.
The algorithm that you develop to serve as the basis for the Java
code that you write should exploit the fact that it processes
arrays whose elements are in increasing order.

</p><p>

<h3>Program Submission</h3>

Submit your source code file (<tt>SameDiference.java</tt>) from the course web
page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is adjacent to the link that 
brought you to this page. (Again, submit <b>only</b> your
<tt>SameDifference.java</tt> file, not the corresponding <tt>.class</tt> file 
nor any other file.) 

</p><p>
Make sure to augment the comments near the top of the class so that you 
identify yourself, acknowledge any persons who aided you in developing your 
solution, and point out any flaws that you know about.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit more than one time. Hence, if, after submitting,
you improve your program (e.g., by fixing logic errors), you should submit 
the newer version.  Every submitted file should have the same name,
namely <tt>SameDifference.java</tt>!

</p><p>
After submitting a file, you can verify that it was copied into the proper
folder by "reviewing" it.  Just refresh the "Submit Page" and links to
all files that you have submitted will appear under your name near the
top left of the page.   Note that when a file with the same name as a
previously-submitted file is submitted, the older file is renamed so
that a time stamp is in its name.
