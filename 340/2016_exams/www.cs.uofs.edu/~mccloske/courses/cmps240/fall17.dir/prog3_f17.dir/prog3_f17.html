<h2>
  CMPS 240  Fall 2017<br />
  Programming Assignment #3: Generic 3-Color Partitioning<br />
  Due: 11:59pm, Monday October 2
</h2>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

</p><p>
In lecture was presented 
<a href="../../two_color_partition.dir/" target="_blank">Java code</a> 
(in the form of one interface, four "instance classes", 
and one application) that implements 2-color array partitioning.
For this assignment, you are to modify that code so as to implement
3-color array partitioning.

</p><p>
Specifically, you are responsible for producing the following
Java program units:

<ul>
  <li><b><tt>RedWhiteBlueClassifier</tt>:</b> 
      generic Java interface analogous to <tt>RedBlueClassifier</tt>, 
      it is to include an <tt>isWhite()</tt> method.
  </li>
  <li><b><tt>NegZeroPosClassifier</tt>:</b> 
      Java class implementing <tt>RedWhiteBlueClassifier</tt> and 
      analogous to <tt>NegPosClassifier</tt>, differing in that it 
      classifies zero as White.
  </li>
  <li><b><tt>YoungMiddleOldClassifier</tt>:</b>
      Java class implementing <tt>RedWhiteBlueClassifier</tt> and 
      classifying <a href="Person.java"><tt>Person</tt></a> 
      objects as being either young (Red), middle-aged (White), 
      or old (Blue).  By default, young means 25 years old or less,
      old means 60 years old or more, and middle-aged is what's left
      between.  However, the client creating an object of this class
      must be able to specify the young/middle and middle/old boundaries
      by passing parameters to a constructor.
  </li>
  <li><b><tt>RedWhiteBluePartitioner</tt>:</b>
      generic Java class analogous to <tt>RedBluePartitioner</tt>, 
      differing in that it performs 3-color partitioning rather than 2-color.
      Of course, there being three post-partition array segments of interest,
      and hence two boundaries between them, this class needs two methods
      for returning boundary information (<tt>redWhiteBoundary()</tt> and
      <tt>whiteBlueBoundary()</tt>) rather than only one.
      </p><p>
      The <tt>partition()</tt> method in the <tt>RedBluePartitioner</tt> 
      class provided to you includes <tt>assert</tt> statements for the 
      purpose of verifying the truth of its stated loop invariant after
      each loop iteration.  It is expected that your code will include
      analogous <tt>assert</tt> statements.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
For all but the <tt>YoungMiddleOldClassifier</tt> class, it is recommended that
you make a copy of the analogous interface/class used in 2-partitioning and
modify it to suit your needs.  Make sure to update the comments appropriately.
For <tt>YoungMiddleOldClassifier</tt>, make a copy of
<tt>NegZeroPosClassifier</tt> and modify it.

</p><p>
For testing purposes, you can use the Java application
<a href="Partition3App.java"><tt>Partition3App</tt></a>.
If it doesn't work correctly, there is almost certainly
something wrong with your code.
</p><p>
Java's <tt>assert</tt> statement is a useful tool that aids the 
program testing process.  Oddly, however, by default
<tt>assert</tt> statements are ignored when a Java application
is executed.  Thus, to make use of them, you have to "turn on" 
assertion checking.
In jGrasp, you click on the <b>Build</b> menu and then click on
the Enable Assertions box (so that a check mark appears in it).


<h3>Program Submission</h3>

Submit your four source code files, namely 
<tt>RedWhiteBlueClassifier.java</tt>,
<tt>NegZeroPosClassifier.java</tt>,
<tt>YoungMiddleOldClassifier.java</tt>, and
<tt>RedWhiteBluePartitioner.java</tt>
(and <b>no others</b>) from the course web
page using the <b>Submit/Review</b> link that is
adjacent to the link that brought you to this page.

</p><p>
Make sure to augment the comments near the top of each class to identify
yourself and to point out any flaws of which you are aware.
In at least one of them, list the names of any persons who aided 
you in developing your solution.

</p><p>
Be aware that you can submit source code files more than one time.
If, after submitting your work, you make corrections or improvements in one of
your source code files, submit only that file for a second (or whatever) time.
In other words, there is no point in submitting a file if it has not changed
since the last time you submitted it! 

</p><p>
After submitting a file, you can verify that it was copied into the proper
folder by "reviewing" it.  Just refresh the "Submit Page" and links to
all files that you have submitted will appear under your name near the
top left of the page.   Note that when a file with the same name as a
previously-submitted file is submitted, the older file is renamed so
that a time stamp is in its name.
