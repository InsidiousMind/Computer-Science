<b>1.</b> Develop a solution for the Three-Color Partition problem.
<!-- Dutch National Flag --> 
Given is an array <tt>A[]</tt> each element of which is classified as 
being exactly one among RED, WHITE, or BLUE.  
Using <tt>N</tt> as a shorthand for <tt>a.length</tt>, 
the postcondition is as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
   0             r               w              N
  +-------------+---------------+--------------+
A |   all RED   |   all WHITE   |   all BLUE   |
  +-------------+---------------+--------------+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
In words, this says that <tt>0&le;r&le;w&le;N</tt> and that
every element in A[0..r-1] is RED,
every element in A[r..w-1] is WHITE, and
every element in A[w..N-1] is BLUE.

</p><p>
Clearly a loop is needed to solve this problem.
Employing the <em>replace a constant by a fresh variable</em>
heuristic, we can restate the postcondition by replacing
both occurrences of <tt>N</tt> by fresh variable <tt>b</tt> 
and inserting <tt>b==N</tt> as a new conjunct.  
The negation of the new conjunct will become the loop's guard.
The original postcondition, with <tt>b</tt> replacing <tt>N</tt>,
will be the loop's invariant.  As a diagram, the loop invariant
looks like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
   0           r             w            b            N
  +-----------+-------------+------------+------------+
A |  all RED  |  all WHITE  |  all BLUE  |     ?      |  &and;  0&le;r&le;w&le;b&le;N
  +-----------+-------------+------------+------------+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
In words, this says that <tt>0&le;r&le;w&le;b&le;N</tt> and that
every element in <tt>A[0..r-1]</tt> is RED,
every element in <tt>A[r..w-1]</tt> is WHITE, and
every element in <tt>A[w..b-1]</tt> is BLUE.
(It says nothing about the values of elements in <tt>A[b..N-1]</tt>.)

</p><p>
Arrive at your solution by correctly replacing each question mark in
the program below with either an expression or a sequence of statements,
whichever is appropriate.  You are to assume the existence of a method
<tt>swap()</tt> such that the call <tt>swap(i,j)</tt> has the effect
of swapping the values at locations <tt>i</tt> and <tt>j</tt> of
<tt>A[]</tt>.  (If <tt>i==j</tt>, it has no effect.)

</p><p>
To make matters explicit: In order for a solution to be correct,
<ol>
  <li>the initialization of <tt>r</tt>, <tt>w</tt>, and <tt>b</tt> must
      result in the loop invariant necessarily being true, regardless of
      the contents of <tt>A[]</tt> (which means that each of 
      <tt>A[0..r-1]</tt>, <tt>A[r..w-1]</tt>, and <tt>A[w..b-1]</tt>
      must be segments of length zero),
  </li>
  <li>execution of the loop body, beginning in a state in which the
      loop invariant is true, must not only result in a state in which the 
      loop invariant is true but also decrease the length of the
      ?-region of <tt>A[]</tt> (namely, <tt>A[b..N-1]</tt>).
  </li>
</ol>

<b>2.</b> Develop an alternative solution to the 3-color Partition Problem.
This time, we employ the <em>replace an occurrence of a variable with a fresh
variable</em> heuristic.  Specifically, we replace <tt>w</tt> by <tt>m</tt>
in the condition stating that every element in <tt>A[r..w-1]</tt> is WHITE.

</p><p>
This leads us to adopting the following as a loop invariant:

</p><p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
   0           r           m             w            N
  +-----------+-----------+-------------+------------+
A |  all RED  |     ?     |  all WHITE  |  all BLUE  |    &and;  0&le;r&le;m&le;w&le;N
  +-----------+-----------+-------------+------------+</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Complete the code below in a manner that respects this loop invariant.
The loop body should be an <b>if-else</b> statement with at least
three branches.  It's possible to guarantee that two distinct elements
of the same color are never swapped.  This is not a requirement, but
it is preferred.  In order to ensure that the loop invariant is true
after initializing <tt>r</tt>, <tt>m</tt>, and <tt>w</tt>, it must
be that each of <tt>A[0..r-1]</tt>, <tt>A[m..w-1]</tt>, and
<tt>A[w..N-1]</tt> has length zero.


</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>
/* precondition: every element in A[0..N-1] is either RED, WHITE, or BLUE */

r = ?;  m = ?;  w = ?;

/* loop invariant:
**   0&le;r&le;m&le;w&le;N  &and;
**   every element in A[0..r-1] is RED &and; 
**   every element in A[m..w-1] is WHITE &and; 
**   every element in A[w..N-1] is BLUE 
*/
while ( ? )  {


   ?

}
/* post: 0&le;r&le;m&le;w&le;N  &and; 
**       every element in A[0..r-1] is RED &and; 
**       every element in A[m..w-1] is WHITE &and; 
**       every element in A[w..N-1] is BLUE &and;
**       r==m
