HW #1 Sample Solutions
</h2>

<p>
Neither problem has a unique solution, of course;
the ones shown here are good ones.
Code not included in the provided "answer form"
is shown in boldface.
</p><p>
It is intended that an augmented version of this
document will be made available in the near future.
In addition to the solutions shown here, it will
include narratives describing the reasoning behind
the choices that were made in developing those
solutions. It will also point out subtle flaws
that exist in slightly different, but incorrect,
"soltions".
