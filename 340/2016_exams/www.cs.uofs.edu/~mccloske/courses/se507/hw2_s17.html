<h2>SE 507 Spring 2017<br />
HW #2: Statecharts<br />
Due: Thursday, March 23
</h2>


</p><p>
<b>1.</b>
In class we developed a statechart describing the intended behavior of 
an <b>elevator display machine</b>.
To keep things simple, we assumed that there was
only one <b>summons button</b> on each floor, so that a potential
passenger could convey the wish to be picked up at a particular
floor but could not also convey the direction in which (s)he 
intended to go from there (up vs. down).  Under this assumption,
we had little choice but to also assume that, if the elevator car 
stopped at a floor (and the doors were opened), then all 
pending service requests associated with that floor had been
satisfied.

</p><p>
In most real life elevator systems, each floor (other than those at 
the low and high extremes) has two summons buttons, one to ask to go
upward and the other to ask to go downward.
It is assumed that a person who pressed a summons button
will not enter the elevator car unless its current direction is 
consistent with that in which (s)he wants to go.

</p><p>
Explain how, in this more realistic scenario, the 
elevator display machine could be made to determine whether or not a 
floor summons request had been satisfied.
What kind of inference would the machine have to make?
(Recall that we are assuming that the elevator display machine
has access to floor sensor outputs but not to any information about
the state of the elevator system's motor's directional setting.)

<b>2.</b>
Develop a StateChart diagram that depicts the behavior of a
DVD player consistent with the informal description given next.
Point out any ambiguities in the informal description and
resolve each one in a reasonable way.
Make use of hierarchical state structure (states within states)
in an appropriate way.  


</p><p>
<blockquote>
The DVD player has five buttons: <b>power</b>, <b>eject</b>,
<b>play</b>, <b>stop</b>, and <b>pause</b>.

</p><p>
Initially, the player is <b>off</b>.
Pressing the <b>power button</b> acts to toggle the player between being
<b>on</b> and <b>off</b>.  Moreover, this is the only button that has
any effect when the player is off.

</p><p>
Pressing the <b>eject</b> button acts to toggle the player's <b>tray</b>
between being <b>open</b> and <b>closed</b>.
Only the <b>power</b> and <b>eject</b> buttons have any effect
when the tray is open.  If the tray is open when the player is turned
off, the tray will close first.

</p><p>
When the player is on and the tray is closed, the <b>motor</b> is 
either <b>spinning</b> or <b>idle</b>.
It starts spinning (and tries to read the metadata stored on the disk
in the tray) whenever the player goes from off to on or the 
tray goes from open to closed.
If either the disk is absent or the player cannot read it, 
an error message is displayed and all but the 
<b>eject</b> and <b>power</b> buttons are disabled.
Otherwise, the other three buttons are enabled, as the disk is ready
to be played. 
In either case, the motor is idled.

</p><p>
Pressing the <b>start</b> button causes the player to start 
(or continue) playing the disk.
Pressing the <b>stop</b> button causes the motor to become idle.
Pressing the <b>pause</b> button does not idle the motor but is
for toggling between a state in which the disk is playing and one
in which playing has been paused.  The <b>pause</b> button has
no effect when the motor is idle.
