Notes on <em>Deriving Specifications from Requirements: An Example</em><br />
by Michael Jackson and Pamela Zave
</H2>

This web page follows the material presented in Sections 1-8 of the
paper mentioned in the title, hereafter referred to by DSR, which appeared 
on pages 15-24 of the Proceedings of ICSE'95 (ACM's 1995 International
Conference on Software Engineering).
It also draws some information from other papers co-authored by
Jackson and Zave, including
<ul>
  <li><em>Four Dark Corners of Requirements Engineering</em> (FDC),
      from ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology,
      Vol. 6, No. 1, Jan. 1997, pp. 1-30.
  </li>
  <li><em>The Meaning of Requirements</em> (MR),
      from Annals of Software Engineering, Vol. 3 (1997), pp. 5-21.
  </li>
  <li><em>A Reference Model for Requirements and Specifications</em> (RMRS),
      from IEEE Software, May/June 2000, pp. 37-43.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
First we review some terms that Jackson uses, which are
summarized on page 24 of FDC.

<ul>
  <li>The <em>environment</em> is the portion of the "real world" relevant
      to the software development project.
  </li>
  <li>A <em>requirement</em> is a desired relationship among the 
      <em>phenomena</em> (e.g., actions/events, states) of the environment.
      It is stated in the <em>optative</em> mood, meaning that it is
      intended as a wish or desire.  (Such a statement is often referred to
      as being <em>prescriptive</em>.)

  <li>The <em>machine</em> is the hardware/software entity the purpose of
      which is to interact with the environment in such a way as to ensure
      that the requirements are established/satisfied/maintained.
  </li>
  <li>A <em>specification</em> describes machine behavior (at its interface
      with the environment) sufficient to achieve one or more requirements.
      Viewed from the machine, a specification is a starting point for
      programming; viewed from the environment, it is a 
      <!-- restricted kind of requirement in that  -->
      requirement in which all phenomena mentioned must be shared with
      the machine and any constraints imposed must be upon phenomena
      that are controlled by the machine.
  </li>
  <li><em>Domain knowledge</em> consists of facts/properties (or assumptions)
      about (phenomena in) the environment that hold regardless of
      whether or not the machine is present.
      It is stated in the <em>indicative</em> mood, meaning that it is
      intended to be a statement of fact.  (Such a statement is often
      referred to as being <em>descriptive</em>.)
      Such knowledge is used in refining requirements into specifications.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Given a requirement, we progress to a specification by purging the
requirement of all features that would preclude implementation by the
machine.
Which features are these?
<b>Answer:</b>Any that refer to environment phenomena that are not
accessible to (i.e., shared with) the machine or that impose constraints
upon phenomena that the machine does not control.

<hr>
<H3>Phenomena: Issues of Visibility/Sharing and Control</H3>

</p><p>
In Jackson's way of looking at things (see RMRS), phenomena are 
partitioned into four categories, according to who <b>controls</b> them
and to whom they are <b>visible</b>.
<ol>
  <li><b><em>e<sub>h</sub></em></b>: 
      controlled (or initiated) by the <b>e</b>nvironment and 
      <b>h</b>idden from (i.e., invisible to, not shared with) the machine.
      <br />
      <b>Examples:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>the property of there being four people on the elevator car</li>
        <li>the "event" in which a person enters the elevator car</li>
        <li>The property of the elevator being at the 3rd floor</li>
        <li>The property of the elevator being in a "moving" (as opposed
            to "stationary") state
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p><p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>e<sub>v</sub></em></b>: controlled by the <b>e</b>nvironment
       but <b>v</b>isible to (i.e., shared with) the machine.
       <br /> 
       <b>Examples:</b>
       <ul>
         <li>the state of the sensor that indicates whether or not
             the elevator car is at the 3rd floor
         </li>
         <li>the event of someone pressing the DOWN button on floor 8.</li>
       </ul>
      </p><p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>s<sub>v</sub></em></b>: controlled by the machine 
      (i.e., <b>s</b>ystem) but <b>v</b>isible to (shared with) 
      the environment.
      <br />
      <b>Example:</b> the action/event of the machine signaling 
         the elevator's motor to turn on.
      </p><p>
  </li>
  <li><b><em>s<sub>h</sub></em></b>: controlled by the machine
      (i.e., <b>s</b>ystem) and <b>h</b>idden from (i.e., not shared with)
      the environment.
      <br />
      <b>Examples:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>the value of program variable <tt>currentFloor</tt>. </li>
        <li>the subroutine <tt>checkSensor()</tt>. </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
The phenomena in the union of <em>e<sub>v</sub></em> and
<em>s<sub>v</sub></em>, being those that are visible to both
environment and machine (i.e., shared among them), 
are at the <em>interface</em> between the two.
(See Venn diagram on page 38 of RMRS.)

<p>
Domain knowledge, and likewise requirements, involve 
only environment-controlled phenomena
(i.e. those in the set <em>e</em> = <em>e<sub>h</sub></em> <tt>&cup;</tt>
<em>e<sub>v</sub></em>).
<!-- (which is shorthand for the union of <em>e<sub>h</sub></em> and -->

<!-- 
  Likewise, requirements resulting from the "requirements analysis" phase of
  software development involve only phenomena from <em>e</em>,
  most of which are typically from <em>e<sub>h</sub></em>.
-->

</p><p>
A <em>specification</em> describes intended behavior of the machine at
its interface with the environment &mdash;and hence mentions only
phenomena in <em>e<sub>v</sub></em> and <em>s<sub>v</sub></em>&mdash;
sufficient for ensuring that the requirements are satisfied,
provided that the domain knowledge that has been ascertained is
accurate.
Furthermore, any constraints mentioned in a specification
must be imposed upon phenomena in <em>s<sub>v</sub></em>
(or <em>s<sub>h</sub></em>?),
or else the machine, which directly controls only such phenomena,
would not be capable of implementing it.

</p><p>
From the point of view of the machine, a specification is a starting
point for programming.  That is, it describes how a program must behave.
From the point of view of the environment, a specification is a
special case of a requirement.

</p><p>
The main idea of this paper is to illustrate the idea of deriving
a specification from a requirement by purging the latter of 
all features that would preclude implementation by the machine.

</p><p>
Doing this relies upon the use of domain knowledge, which allows
us to reason about constraints that the machine can impose upon 
environment-controlled phenomena (i.e., those in <em>e</em>), 
indirectly, by constraining those in <em>s<sub>v</sub></em>

<H2>The Example: Zoo Turnstile</H2>

</p><p>
Our problem involves a zoo to which customers gain entry by inserting a
coin/token into a slot, which allows them to pass through a turnstile.
This mechanical apparatus has already been chosen, setting the
limits of the environment for which the requirements must be stated.
Hence, the requirements cannot be about the profitability of the zoo,
or the best use of the real estate that it occupies, or what price should
be charged to enter the zoo, or whether the owner would be better off
if he sold the zoo and took up yoga.  All of these are outside the scope
of the problem.

</p><p>
The goal is to develop software that controls the turnstile in
such a way that no one can enter without paying and anyone who has
paid is allowed to enter.  (More precisely, at no time may the number
of people who have entered exceed the number of payments that have
been made.)
It is assumed that there is an electrical interface through which
the machine can sense coins being dropped into the coin slot and 
through which it can control the turnstile by initiating lock and unlock
events.

<H3>Designating Environment Phenomena</H3>

</p><p>
Jackson emphasizes (especially in MR) the idea that a 
small-as-possible collection of <b>ground terms</b> should be 
<b>designated</b> to enable us to write descriptions of 
(and constraints upon) environment phenomena.
A designation associates a ground term (typically a predicate) to
an informal, but precise, description of the environment phenomenon
to which it refers.

</p><p>
As Jackson puts it, "Ground terms serve to fix the relationship 
between the description and what it describes."

</p><p>
All other terms will be <b>defined</b> in terms of the ground terms.
Definitions are simply for the purpose of providing shorter and
simpler descriptions, but they add nothing in terms of descriptive
capabilities. <!-- (Example: aunt, expected-widgets-in-inventory) -->

</p><p>
Example from pages 13-14 of MR: the set of ground terms 
<tt>{male, female, parent}</tt> is sufficient for describing 
family relationships (aunt, sister, second cousin, etc.).
(<b>Note:</b> if we assume that <tt>male(x) = &not;female(x)</tt>, 
only one among <tt>male</tt> and <tt>female</tt> is needed
as a ground term, as either one can be defined in terms of the other!)

</p><p>
For the Zoo Turnstile problem, we use the common technique of designating 
actions/events by predicates.  That is, for each different kind of
action/event, we designate a predicate that "recognizes" precisely
that kind of action/event.
<ul>
  <li><b>Push(e)</b> : 
      <em>e</em> is an event in which a visitor has pushed the turnstile
      "arm", causing it to rotate to an "intermediate" position
      from which it must continue rotating to a "home" position.
      (This statement is from the environment's point of view.)
      </p><p>
      From the machine's point of view, <em>e</em> is an event in
      which an electrical signal is received (from the turnstile)
      indicating that the turnstile's arm rotated to the
      intermediate position referred to above.
  </li>
  <li><b>Enter(e)</b> :
      <em>e</em> is an event in which a visitor, 
      <!-- pushes the turnstile to its "home" position, -->
      having pushed the turnstile "arm" all the way to its "home" position,
      passes through the gate, thereby entering the zoo
  </li>
  <li><b>Coin(e)</b> : 
      <em>e</em> is an event in which a visitor inserts a coin in the slot.
      (From the machine's point of view, it is the reception of an
      electrical signal indicating that a coin was inserted.)
  </li>
  <li><b>Lock(e)</b> : 
      <em>e</em> is an event in which the turnstile receives a signal to lock.
      (From the machine's point of view, it is the sending of such a signal.)
  </li>
  <li><b>Unlock(e)</b> :
      <em>e</em> is an event in which the turnstile receives a signal to
      unlock.
      (From the machine's point of view, it is the sending of such a signal.)
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
These all happen to be one-argument predicates; in general, the
designated terms will tend to include multi-argument predicates, too.

<p>
Classifying the just-designated terms, we have that 
<ul>
  <li><em>e<sub>h</sub></em> includes <b>Enter()</b></li>
  <li><em>e<sub>v</sub></em> includes <b>Coin()</b> and <b>Push()</b></li>
  <li><em>s<sub>v</sub></em> includes <b>Lock()</b> and <b>Unlock()</b> 
</ul>
<p>
Because the occurrence of events through the passage of time is what is at
issue here, we also make the following designations, which assume that events
and intervals between events are "individuals" that strictly alternate.
That is, each event "ends" some interval and "begins" another.
This is suggested by the following "timeline" picture, 
in which vertical bars indicate events and dashed line segments are the 
intervals between them.

<pre><center>
-----------|---|------|----------|---|--|------|--- ... 
</center>
</pre>

</p><p>
With respect to events and intervals, we designate the following
standard set of predicates:
<ul>
  <li><b>Event(e)</b> : e is an (atomic and instantaneous) event </li>
  <li><b>Interval(v)</b> : v is an interval (during which no event occurs)</li>
  <li><b>Earlier(e,t)</b> : event e occurs earlier than event t</li>
  <li><b>Begins(e,v)</b> : the occurrence of event e marks 
      the beginning of interval v</li>
  <li><b>Ends(e,v)</b> : the occurrence of event e marks
      the end of interval v</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The assumption is that <b>Earlier()</b> defines a total ordering on events,
meaning that, viewed as a binary relation on events, <b>Earlier</b> is
anti-reflexive, transitive, and has the property that, 
for every pair of distinct events <tt>e</tt> and <tt>f</tt>,
exactly one of <b>Earlier(e,f)</b> and  <b>Earlier(f,e)</b> is true.

</p><p>
Note that if we were not assuming events to be instantaneous, we'd have
to introduce phenomena relating to the delay between, for example,
the coin being inserted into the slot and the machine sensing it.
(In that case, a coin being inserted would not be an event visible
to the machine, but the "coin entered" signal that reaches it later 
would be.)
(In terms of <b>problem frames</b>, this would mean that there would
be a <b>connection domain</b> in between the machine domain and the
domain containing the coin accepter mechanism.)

</p><p>
Another important thing to remember about events and intervals is that
the former are what cause changes in state; hence, during any particular
interval the state remains fixed.  (Thus, it makes sense to define
predicates whose purpose is to characterize the state that exists
during an interval.)

<hr>

<H3>IND1</H3>
</p><p>
Jackson begins his analysis by describing an <b>indicative safety property</b>
of the environment, which is an example of domain knowledge.
<!--  page 18: IND1;  page 14 of FDC: G1): -->
(A safety property refers to one that prohibits certain events from
happening in certain states/situations).

</p><p>
<em>Note:</em>
The names of properties in boldface are taken from DSR; 
the ones in parentheses are from FDC, which also discusses the
zoo problem, but not in its entirety.
<!-- (The Buchi automata appearing in FDC are better insofar as  -->
(The finite state machines (FSM's) depicted in FDC have the advantage that
final states are indicated.)
<em>End of note.</em>

</p><p>
<b>IND1</b> (G1) says that <b>Push</b> and <b>Enter</b> events 
must strictly alternate, beginning with a <b>Push</b>.
This is a property of the turnstile mechanism.
(See <!--Buchi automaton--> 
the <b>finite state machine</b> (henceforth, <b>FSM</b>)
on page 18 of DSR or page 14 of FDC.)

</p><p>
Note that the states <b>PE0</b> and <b>PE1</b> appearing in the FSM
<!-- automaton-->
are, in effect, predicates being defined in terms of (the designated terms)
<b>Push</b> and <b>Enter</b>.
Informally, we can give the definitions

</p><p>
<b>PE0(v)</b> = 
 among all events to occur earlier than the one ending interval <em>v</em>,
 either none was a <b>Push</b> or else an <b>Enter</b> occurred sometime after
 the most recent occurrence of <b>Push</b> 

</p><p>
<b>PE1(v)</b> = 
 among all events to occur earlier than the one ending interval <em>v</em>,
 at least one was a <b>Push</b> and no <b>Enter</b> occurred after the most
 recent occurrence of <b>Push</b>.

</p><p>
We leave it to the reader to provide formal definitions of 
the predicates PE0 and PE1 in terms of the designated terms.
Having defined these, we can express IND1 as follows:

</p><p><center>
<b>IND1</b>: 
    (<tt>&forall;</tt>e,v | PE0(v) &and; Ends(e,v) <tt>:</tt> &not;Enter(e)) 
    &nbsp; &and; &nbsp;
      (<tt>&forall;</tt>e,v | PE1(v) &and; Ends(e,v) <tt>:</tt> &not;Push(e))
</center>

</p><p>
<em>Note:</em> Strictly speaking, each universal quantification above
should have in its range the conjuncts <tt>Event(e) &and; Interval(v)</tt>,
but in order to minimize clutter, here we shall assume, in all the examples,
that dummy <b>e</b> is an event (i.e., satisfies <b>Event(e)</b>),
dummy <b>v</b> is an interval (i.e., satisfies <b>Interval(v)</b>),
and dummies <tt>n</tt> and <tt>m</tt> are integers (i.e., satisfy
<b>Integer(n)</b> and <b>Integer(m)</b>, respectively).
<em>End of note.</em>

</p><p>
Notice that the formal version of <b>IND1</b> says that, if the turnstile is
in state <b>PE0</b> (respectively, <b>PE1</b>), the next event to occur 
cannot be an <b>Enter</b> (respectively, <b>Push</b>).
<b>IND1</b> does <em>not</em> say that, if the turnstile is in state
<b>PE0</b> (respectively, <b>PE1</b>), the next event to occur 
<em>must be</em> a <b>Push</b> (respectively, <b>Enter</b>).
Why not?

<hr>

<H3>IND2</H3>
<p>
The second indicative property, <b>IND2</b> (G4) 
(which, like IND1, is a safety property), 
says that if <b>Lock</b> and <b>Unlock</b> events have alternated
in the past, beginning with <b>Unlock</b>, then a <b>Push</b>
cannot occur if a <b>Lock</b> occurred more recently than the most
recent occurrence of <b>Unlock</b>.

<p>
The reason for stating this property as an implication (if ... then ...) is
that we don't know how the turnstile will behave (i.e., whether or not it
will allow a <b>Push</b> to occur) following two <b>Lock</b> events
occurring without an intervening <b>Unlock</b> or two <b>Unlock</b>
events occurring without an intervening <b>Lock</b>.
(Why don't we know?  Presumably, either because the turnstile
manufacturer's reference manual does not say, or because that manual says
that the turnstile's behavior will be unpredictable in such circumstances.)

<p>
In order to simplify the description <b>IND2</b>, we first define the
predicates <b>LU0</b> (locked), <b>LU1</b> (unlocked), and
<b>LU2</b> (unknown) in terms of the sequence of <b>Lock</b> and 
<b>Unlock</b> events that have occurred.
This definition is called <b>DEF1</b> and is done by means of a 
<!--Buchi automaton--> FSM.  (See bottom right of page 18 in DSR or 
the FSM <!--automaton--> labeled G4 on page 14 of FDC.)

<p>
Notice that <b>DEF1</b> is purely definitional, in the sense that
it asserts no safety or liveness constraints.
(<b>Note:</b> A <b>safety</b> constraint is one that prohibits some
kind of event from occurring; a <b>liveness</b> constraint is one that
insists upon the occurrence of some kind of event.)
Its only purpose is to define the three predicates
<b>LU0</b>, <b>LU1</b>, and <b>LU2</b>.
We leave it to the reader to provide their formal definitions using
predicate logic.
<!-- of the predicates corresponding to these states. -->

<p>
Using the states/predicates defined in <b>DEF1</b>, we can express <b>IND2</b>
as follows:

<p>
<b>IND2</b> (G4):  When the turnstile is locked (i.e., is in state <b>LU0</b>),
a <b>Push</b> cannot occur.

<p>
More formally,
<p><center>
<b>IND2</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>e,v |
    LU0(v) &and; Ends(e,v) &nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp; &not;Push(e))
</center>

<p>
<hr>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
Interestingly, from the indicative statements in DSR it is not
possible to conclude that every <b>Push</b> is followed (at some
later time) by an <b>Enter</b>.  <!-- (Or is it?  Explore this.) -->
On the other hand, FDC includes an indicative statement, <b>G2</b>, 
which says that, assuming that <b>Push</b> and <b>Enter</b> events
have alternated so far, beginning with a <b>Push</b>, every <b>Push</b>
must be followed (at some point in time) by either a <b>Push</b> or 
an <b>Enter</b>. 

<p>
From <b>IND1</b> (G1) and G2, one <em>can</em> conclude that 
every <b>Push</b> is followed (at some point in time) by an 
<b>Enter</b>, giving us a liveness property.
<!-- Should that property be stated here in detail? -->
<b>End of note.</b>


<H3>The Requirements</H3>
<p>
There are basically two:
<ol>
  <li>No one should enter without paying.</li>
  <li>Anyone who has paid should be allowed to enter.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It would be too constraining to require that <b>Coin</b> and
<b>Enter</b> events strictly alternate.
(Imagine a scenario in which one person drops several coins into
the slot in order to pay for a group of people behind her in the
turnstile queue.)  Hence, the machine should allow payments to be made
"in advance".  A more precise way to state the two requirements, then, is
<ol>
  <li>At any moment, the number of <b>Enter</b> events to have occurred
      must not exceed the number of <b>Coin</b> events to have occurred.
  </li>
  <li>At any moment at which the number of <b>Coin</b> events to have occurred
      exceeds the number of <b>Enter</b> events to have occurred, an
      <b>Enter</b> event must be allowed to occur.
  </li>
</ol>



<p>
To make the descriptions of the requirements more concise,
Jackson first defines predicates <b>Push#(v,n)</b>, 
<b>Enter#(v,n)</b>, and <b>Coin#(v,n)</b> meaning, respectively, 
that the number of <b>Push</b>, <b>Enter</b>, and <b>Coin</b> events, 
respectively, occurring before interval <em>v</em> was <em>n</em>.

<p>
It's not clear to me why we should prefer to use these three predicates
rather than the integer functions <b>#Push(v)</b>, <b>#Enter(v)</b>, and
<b>#Coin(v)</b> having the property 
<p><center><tt>
(#Push(v) = n) &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; Push#(v,n) </tt></center>
<p>
and similarly for <b>#Enter</b> and <b>#Coin</b>.

<!--
<p>
Using these, we can state requirement 1 as <b>OPT1</b> (also G5) 
(see bottom of left column on page 19 in DSR), 

<p><center>
<b>OPT1</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v,m,n &nbsp; |: &nbsp; 
   Interval(v) &and; Integer(m) &and; Integer(n) &nbsp; : 
    &nbsp; Enter#(v,m) &and; Coin#(v,n) &nbsp; <tt>&rArr;</tt> 
    &nbsp; m &le; n)
</center>
-->
<p>
Using these integer functions, we can state requirement 1 as 
<b>OPT1</b> (see bottom of left column on page 19 in DSR), 
(also see the <!--Buchi automaton--> FSM G5 on page 14 of FDC).

<p><center>
<b>OPT1</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v  |:  <!-- Interval(v) -->
    #Enter(v) &le; #Coin(v))
</center>

<p>
Requirement 2, <b>OPT2</b>, is that a visitor whose entry fee has been
paid will not be prevented from entering.  Partially informally, this
can be stated as

<!--
<p><center>
<b>OPT2</b>: (&forall;v,m,n &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
             Interval(v) &and; Integer(m) &and; Integer(n) &nbsp; : &nbsp;
             Enter#(v,m) &and; Coin#(v,n) &and; m &lt; n 
             &nbsp; <tt>&rArr;</tt> &nbsp;
             Enter event is allowed to occur)
</center>
-->
<p><center>
<b>OPT2</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v | <!--Interval(v) : -->
             #Enter(v) &lt; #Coin(v) &nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp;
             <b>Enter</b> event is allowed to occur to end v)
</center>

<p>
Later we will make <b>OPT2</b> more precise.

<hr>
<H3>Specifications</H3>
Both requirements and specifications are expressed in terms of
environmental phenomena. 
A requirement describes a desired relationship among environmental
phenomena (typically ones that are of direct interest to
customers/users); a specification describes a desired, implementable
behavior of the machine in the environment
(for the purpose of ensuring the satisfaction of some requirement(s)).
Hence, all specifications are requirements, but
not all requirements are specifications.
<p>
As Jackson explains in the right column on page 19 of DSR,
to be a specification, a requirement must be such that
<ol>
  <li>all environment phenomena mentioned are shared with the machine
     (i.e., are in either <em>e<sub>v</sub></em> or <em>s<sub>v</sub></em>).
  </li>
  <li>all phenomena that are constrained are machine-controlled
      (i.e., in <em>s<sub>v</sub></em>).
  </li>
  <li>all constraints upon events are expressed in terms of preceding
      events or states in preceding intervals.  That is, the conditions
      for causing, or preventing from happening, an event can be
      evaluated in the current state, without the need for making use
      of any (possible) future state.
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
By this definition, neither <b>OPT1</b> nor <b>OPT2</b> is a specification!

</p><p>
Why?
Because both are expressed in terms of <b>Enter</b> events, which are not 
visible to (i.e., shared with) the machine.  Hence, (1) is violated.

</p><p>
To realize <b>OPT1</b>, the machine must either force <b>Coin</b> events
to occur or prevent <b>Enter</b> events from occurring.
Either way, (2) is violated because the machine controls neither
<b>Coin</b> nor <b>Enter</b> events.

</p><p>
Jackson explains that <b>OPT1</b> also fails to satisfy (3):
<blockquote>
OPT1 also constrains the state in every interval, including those
that are still in the future.  When the machine executes, or refrains
from executing, any event, it must ensure that OPT1 will hold
<em>afterwards</em>.  A requirement based in this way on a future
state ... cannot be a specification...
</blockquote>
However, Jackson provides no precise criteria by which to determine
whether a requirement violates (3).

Interestingly, he says nothing about OPT2 violating (3),
which suggests that there is no such violation.
And why not?
Here is your instructor's understanding as to why.
Notice a crucial difference between OPT1 and OPT2: 
unlike the former, the latter imposes a constraint upon program behavior
that applies only in well-defined (and recognizable) situations,
namely those in which the number of Enter events to have occured
is less than the number of Coin events to have occurred.
Moreover, OPT2 indicates explicitly that, in those situations,
a specific kind of event is not to be prevented from occurring.
OPT1, on the other hand, fails to indicate anything specific
about what types of events are necessary, prohibited, or allowed, or
about in which situations/states these conditions prevail.


<!--  WRONG!  See above
Interestingly, he says nothing about OPT2 violating (3),
yet there seems to be no particular difference in the forms of
OPT1 and OPT2 that distinguishes them with respect to this issue.

<H3>Refining Requirements to Obtain Specifications</H3>
<p>
To obtain a specification from the requirements, we make use of the
indicative environment properties (i.e., domain knowledge).

<p>
Letting R be the requirements and E the indicative environment properties,
we want to find S (specifications) (meeting (1), (2), and (3) above)
such that 
<p><center>[S &and; E <tt>&rArr;</tt> R]</center>

<p>
meaning that in any state in which both S and E hold, so must R.
This is actually an oversimplification of what we really need,
a topic that is explored in some depth in RMRS.


<H4>Refinement of OPT1</H4>
<p>
Let's try to refine <b>OPT1</b>, which says that the number of
<b>Enter</b> events can never exceed the number of <b>Coin</b> events.
As there is no way for the machine to force <b>Coin</b> events to occur,
it must act to prevent <b>Enter</b> events from occurring in 
certain situations.
The machine does have some (indirect) control over <b>Enter</b> events,
because of the properties asserted in <b>IND1</b> and <b>IND2</b>.
Specifically, <b>IND2</b> says that <b>Push</b> cannot occur if the
turnstile is in the locked state, <b>LU0</b>, which the machine is 
able to cause <!-- (if necessary) --> by instigating a <b>Lock</b> event.
(This assumes that the machine is careful never to cause the turnstile
to enter the "unpredictable" state <b>LU2</b> by sending two <b>Lock</b>
commands without an intervening <b>Unlock</b>, or vice versa.)
Also, <b>IND1</b> says that <b>Push</b> and <b>Enter</b> events
alternate strictly.  Hence &mdash;assuming that an <b>Enter</b> event has
occurred more recently than the most recent occurrence of a <b>Push</b>
event&mdash; the turnstile being in a locked state prevents not only
<b>Push</b> events from occurring but also <b>Enter</b> events!

<p>
Because we need to ensure (as pointed out in the previous paragraph)
that <b>Lock</b>s and <b>Unlock</b>s alternate strictly, in order to
be sure that each <b>Lock</b> brings the turnstile to state <b>LU0</b>
(locked, from which <b>Push</b> is impossible), 
we state it as an optative property:
<p><center>
<b>OPT3</b> (G3): <b>Lock</b> and <b>Unlock</b> events strictly alternate, 
beginning with the latter.
</center>
<p>
We leave it to the reader to provide a formal definition of <b>OPT3</b>.

<p>
From <b>IND1</b> we obtain
<!--
<p><center>
<b>IND3</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v,m,n | Interval(v) &and; Integer(m) &and; Integer(n) :
   Enter#(v,m) &and; Push#(v,n) &nbsp; <tt>&rArr;</tt> &nbsp; n-1 &le; m &le; n)
</center>
-->
<p><center>
<b>IND3</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v |<tt>:</tt> <!--Interval(v) : -->
   #Push(v)-1 &le; #Enter(v) &le; #Push(v))
</center>

</p><p>
This says that, at any moment in time, the number of Push events to have
occurred is either equal to, or exceeds by one, the number of Enter events
to have occurred.  (The latter holds during that fraction of a second
between a Push and the Enter that necessarily follows.)
<!--
</p><p>
This property allows us to express OPT1 in terms of Push# rather than
Enter# (thereby replacing a reference to an entity invisible to the
machine (Enter#) by one visible to it (Push#)):
<p><center>
<b>OPT1a</b>: (&forall;v,m,n &nbsp; | &nbsp; 
   Interval(v) &and; Integer(m) &and; Integer(n) &nbsp; : &nbsp;
    Push#(v,m) &and; Coin#(v,n) &nbsp; <tt>&rArr;</tt> &nbsp; m &le; n)
</center>
-->
</p><p>
This property allows us to express something very close to 
<b>OPT1</b> in terms of <b>#Push</b> rather than <b>#Enter</b>
(thereby replacing a reference to an entity invisible to the
machine (Enter#) by one visible to it (Push#)):

</p><p><center>
<b>OPT1a</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v | <!-- Interval(v) -->
               <tt>:</tt> #Push(v) &le; #Coin(v))
</center>

</p><p>
OPT1a is slightly stronger than OPT1, but only insofar as it
disallows a Push event from occurring when #Coin = #Enter
(which OPT1 does not disallow).
This strengthening is necessary anyway, because the machine has no
way of preventing, even indirectly, an <b>Enter</b> from occurring 
once a <b>Push</b> has occurred.


</p><p>
Now, of the three conditions that a requirement must satisfy
to be a specification (recall discussion above), 
<b>OPT1a</b> fails to satisfy both (2) and (3), 
the former because it constrains phenomena not controlled by the 
machine and the latter because it provides no guidance as to which 
events are mandatory and which are prohibited according to the 
current state.  
(Jackson says that it refers to future states, but this seems 
rather vague.)

</p><p>
Specifically for the purpose of obtaining requirements that satisfy (3),
Jackson refines <b>OPT1a</b> into a safety property (<b>OPT4</b>) 
and a liveness property (<b>OPT7</b>).
<b>OPT4</b> says that <b>Unlock</b> must not occur when the turnstile is
locked (i.e., in state <b>LU0</b>)
and the next visitor has not yet been paid for.
This, of course, will prevent a <b>Push</b> from occurring, thereby
preventing an <b>Enter</b> from occurring, thereby preventing
the number of <b>Enter</b> events from increasing so as to exceed
the number of <b>Coin</b> events. 
<!--, at least when the turnstile is in state <b>LU0</b>. -->

<!--
<p><center>
<b>OPT4</b>: (&forall;v,e,n | 
        LU0(v) &and; Push#(v,n) &and; Coin#(v,n) &nbsp;:&nbsp;
        Ends(e,v)  <tt>&rArr;</tt> &not;Unlock(e))
</center>
-->
<p><center>
<b>OPT4</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v,e &nbsp;|&nbsp;
        LU0(v) &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; #Push(v) = #Coin(v) &nbsp;:&nbsp;
        Ends(e,v) &nbsp;<tt>&rArr;</tt>&nbsp; &not;Unlock(e))
</center>
</p><p>
Why does <b>OPT4</b> satisify condition (3) whereas <b>OPT1a</b> does not?
Because OPT4 indicates a testable condition (in the current state)
that constrains what the machine is allowed to do in the current state.
OPT1a, to the contrary, simply states that a certain condition is to
hold at all times.


</p><p>
<b>OPT7</b> says that, in certain situations,
a <b>Lock</b> event must occur in time to prevent a subsequent <b>Push</b>
(which, of course, inevitably leads to an <b>Enter</b>),
namely when the turnstile is unlocked (i.e., in state <b>LU1</b>) and the 
next visitor has not yet been paid for.
These situations are formally defined as follows:
<!--
<p><center>
<b>(DEF2)</b>: ReqLock(v) == LU1(v) &and;
               (&exist;n |<tt>:</tt> Push#(v,n) &and; Coin#(v,n))
</center>
-->
<p><center>
<b>(DEF2)</b> &nbsp; ReqLock(v) &nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp; LU1(v) &nbsp;&and;&nbsp;
               #Push(v) = #Coin(v)
</center>
<p>
Investigation of the (documentation of the) turnstile mechanism
reveals that hydraulic damping guarantees a delay of at least
750 msecs between a <b>Push</b> and an <b>Enter</b> and an
additional 10 msec between an <b>Enter</b> and the next <b>Push</b>.
That is,
<p><center>
<b>IND4</b>: Duration[PE0] &ge; 10 msec &nbsp; &and; &nbsp;
       Duration[PE1] &ge; 750 msec 
</center>
<p>
Hence, between each <b>Push</b> event and the next, a minimum of 760 msecs
will pass.
Which is to say that the machine has less than that much time to lock the
turnstile from the moment when <b>ReqLock()</b> becomes true.
This gives us <b>OPT7</b>:
<p><center>
<b>OPT7</b>: Duration[ReqLock] &lt; 760 msec
</center>

<br />
<hr>
<H4>Refinement of OPT2</H4>

</p><p>
Recall that <b>OPT2</b> says, informally, that if the next customer's
fee has already been paid (i.e., the number of <b>Coin</b> events 
exceeds the number of <b>Enter</b> events), the machine should not 
prevent an <b>Enter</b> event.
It, like <b>OPT1</b>, is refined into a safety property and a
liveness property.
(See page 21.)

</p><p>
The safety property, <b>OPT5</b>, which isn't absolutely necessary but 
is intended to reduce wear and tear on the turnstile locking mechanism,
says that a <b>Lock</b> event should not occur in the case that the
turnstile is not locked (i.e., is in state <b>LU1</b>) and the
next customer's fee has been paid already:
<p><center>
<b>OPT5</b>: (<tt>&forall;</tt>v,e &nbsp;|&nbsp;
        LU1(v) &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; #Push(v) &lt; #Coin(v) &nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp;
        Ends(e,v) &nbsp;<tt>&rArr;</tt>&nbsp; &not;Lock(e))
</center>

</p><p>
The liveness property, <b>OPT6</b>, says that, if the turnstile is
locked but the next customer's fee has been paid, an <b>Unlock</b>
event must occur, and soon!
This set of states is formalized by:

</p><p><center>
<b>(DEF3)</b> &nbsp; ReqUnlock(v) &nbsp;<tt>:</tt>&nbsp; LU0(v) 
     &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; #Push(v) &lt; #Coin(v))
</center>

</p><p>
Now we can formally give <b>OPT6</b>:
<p><center>
<b>OPT6</b>: Duration[ReqUnlock] &lt; 250 msec
</center>

</p><p>
Jackson gives no particular reason for choosing the duration 250 msec;
it would seem to be based upon a judgement that any delay larger than
that would give customers the impression that the turnstile is 
annoyingly sluggish.
