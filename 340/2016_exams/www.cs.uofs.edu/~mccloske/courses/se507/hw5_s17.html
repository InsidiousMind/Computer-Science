<h3>Chapter 10 exercises</h3>

</p><p>
<ol>
  <li> Do the first exercise at the end of Chapter 10.
       (about classifying concepts in an ambulance-dispatching system).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <!--
  <li> Do the second exercise at the end of Chapter 10,
       which is to provide a precise definition of conceptual objects
       <tt>Incident</tt> and <tt>Mobilization</tt> in the context of 
       an ambulance-dispatching domain.  Don't ask me what van Lamsweerde
       means by "adequate instantiation of the <em>InstanceOf</em> relation".
       Better yet, tell me what he means by it!  To me it sounds like
       a pretentious phrase.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do the third exercise at the end of Chapter 10,
      which is to provide a precise definition of conceptual objects
      <tt>Participant</tt> and <tt>Constraints</tt> in the context of 
      a meeting-scheduling domain.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  -->
  <li>Do the fourth exercise at the end of Chapter 10,
      about domain properties of a train and a book.
      A better wording of the question might be "How should the
      stated domain properties be expressed/represented in the
      relevant object model?"  (van Lamsweerde's term "attached"
      seems a bit odd.)
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do the fifth exercise at the end of Chapter 10,
      about instances of the <tt>Loan</tt> assocation appearing
      and disappearing.  
      <br /><b>Hint:</b> See Section 10.3.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do the tenth exercise at the end of Chapter 10 (which is
      first one on page 393), about relative importance of meeting
      participants.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do the fifteenth exercise at the end of Chapter 10,
      about applying the <em>Tracking</em> assocation pattern
      to the library object model.  See pages 382-383.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do the seventeenth exercise at the end of Chapter 10
      (second from bottom on page 393), about the patient-monitoring system.
  </li>
</ol>
