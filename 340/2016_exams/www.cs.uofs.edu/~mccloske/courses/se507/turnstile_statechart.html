<h2>SE 507<br />
Sample Statechart for Jackson's Zoo Turnstile Problem
</h2>

<p>
What follows is a (tabular) description of a statechart that is intended to
describe the requirements for Jackson's and Zave's Zoo Turnstile Problem,
as we studied in class.
(It is left to the reader to render it in a graphical form.)
The statechart is the orthogonal product of three (super-)states:
</p><p><center>
<tt>Turnstile &times; ActionNeeded &times; CoinsVsPushes</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
For each of these three super-states, we provide a table that lists
each of its constituent states and their transitions,
with the default (i.e., initial) state listed first. 
Each transition is described by the event that triggers it, the condition
necessary for the transition to occur (if applicable), the state to which
the transition goes, and any action/event that is to be generated as a
result of the transition occurring.

</p><p>
We have taken the liberty to assume that there is a variable <tt>paid</tt>
of type integer (with initial value zero) such that its value
(which corresponds to <b>#coin - #push</b>, using notation similar to
that used in class) can be tested in evaluating a condition and can be
changed by a generated action.
