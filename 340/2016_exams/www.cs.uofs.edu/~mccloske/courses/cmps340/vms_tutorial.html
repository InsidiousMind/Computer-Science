DEC Command Language (DCL)<br>
Some Basic Commands
</H2>

<p>
As is typical of machines running the VMS operating system, the command
language (or "shell", in UNIX terminology) by which a user communicates with
<!-- the University's main academic computer, TIGER (tiger.uofs.edu), -->
the CS Dept.'s VAX (<tt>vaxsrv1.cs.uofs.edu</tt>),
is DCL ("Digital Command Language").  Note that VMS is case-insensitive,
which means that it does not distinguish between the lower and upper case
versions of any letter.  In this document, we will show all DCL commands
and file names in upper case.

<p>
To access the CS Dept.'s Vax, you probably will want to use 
some version of <tt>TELNET</tt>.  On the PC's in the department's
Plonsky lab (St. Thomas 488), this can be accomplished by using Putty.
(Students taking the File Processing course will be issued a username
and password.)

<!-- <p>
Regarding how one accesses <tt>TIGER</tt> in the first place, you
probably want to use some version of <tt>TELNET</tt>.
-->

<p>
Herein are described a small number of the most useful commands in DCL.  The
reader is assumed to be familiar with the idea of organizing files as a
hierarchy using directories.  File names under VMS have three parts: a name,
followed by a period, then a (possibly empty) suffix (or extension,
if you prefer), followed by a semicolon, and finally, a version number.
For example, in
<p>
<center><tt>GPA_PROG.COB;17</tt></center>

<p>
<tt>GPA_PROG</tt> is the name, <tt>COB</tt> is the suffix, and 
<tt>17</tt> is the version number.
Certain suffixes have special significance.  For example, directories are
files with the suffix <tt>DIR</tt>.  Files containing DCL "scripts" are
given the suffix <tt>COM</tt>.  
By convention, files containing COBOL programs are suffixed by <tt>COB</tt>.
To refer to a file that is not in the default (i.e., current)
directory, you would use a "path".  For example,

<center><tt>USERS:[HOME.MCCLOSKE.CMPS340]GPA_PROG.COB</tt></center>
<!-- <center><tt>SYS$USERDISK:[MCCLOSKEYR1.CMPS340]GPA_PROG.COB</tt></center>
-->

<p>
refers to the (latest version of the) file named <tt>GPA_PROG.COB</tt>
that resides within the <tt>CMPS340</tt> subdirectory within the 
<tt>MCCLOSKE</tt> <!-- <tt>MCCLOSKEYR1</tt>  -->
subdirectory within the <tt>HOME</tt> subdirectory
on the device <tt>USERS</tt>.  <!-- <tt>SYS$USERDISK</tt>. -->

<hr>
<H3>Logging Off</H3>
<p>
To terminate an interactive terminal session (i.e., log off), use the command
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> LOGOUT</tt>

<p>
or its abbreviation, <tt>LOG</tt>.
(Note that the dollar sign is the prompt to which the user replies.) 

<hr>
<H3>Changing Your Password</H3>
<p>
Use the command
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> SET PASSWORD</tt>

<p>
You will be prompted to enter
your current password and your new one, twice.

<hr>
<H3>Documentation</H3>
<p>
Use the <tt>HELP</tt> command (analogous to Unix's <tt>man</tt>) to view
documentation on how to use the commands in DCL.  That is, enter

<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> HELP</tt>


<p>
To get help on a specific command, <tt>COPY</tt> for example, enter

<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> HELP COPY</tt>

<hr>
<H3>Directories</H3>

<b>Navigation:</b>
<p>
In DCL, the term is "default" directory, rather than Unix's "working"
(or what most of us refer to as "current") directory.

<p>
The path of your default directory is displayed on the first line in
response to the <tt>DIRECTORY</tt> command (see below).
(There may be a better way to ascertain it, but we haven't found it.)
<!-- even Bill Gunshannon doesn't know how!) -->

<p>
To go from the current directory to a subdirectory within it (called
<tt>SAM</tt>, say) you would enter the command

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> SET DEFAULT [.SAM]</tt>

<p>
As <tt>DEFAULT</tt> may be abbreviated as <tt>DEF</tt>, we will do so
hereafter.

<p>
To go from the current directory to its parent, you would enter the command

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> SET DEF [-]</tt>

<p>
As in UNIX, you can move through several levels using a single command,
as in
<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> SET DEF [-.MARY.HELEN]</tt>
<p>
which has the effect of moving from the current directory up to its
parent, then down to its subdirectory <tt>MARY</tt> and then to
<tt>MARY</tt>'s subdirectory <tt>HELEN</tt>.
Strangely, if you "move" to a non-existent subdirectory, no error message
is displayed until after you issue the next command involving the
default directory, such as <tt>DIRECTORY</tt> (see below).
If you find yourself in such a "netherworld", you can get back to your
home directory by entering

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b>
<!-- SET DEF [000000.&lt;</tt><em>your user name</em><tt>&gt;]</tt> -->
SET DEF [HOME.<em>your user name</em>]</tt>

<!--
<p>
Well, that works for me, but students' accounts may be nested one or more
levels deeper.  So I'm not really sure.
-->

<p><br>
<b>Listing File Names:</b>

<p>
To get a listing of all (names of) files in the default (i.e., current)
directory, enter the command
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIRECTORY</tt>


<p>
As <tt>DIRECTORY</tt> may be abbreviated as <tt>DIR</tt>, we will do
so hereafter.

<p>
Using the "wildcard" character, <tt>*</tt>, the listing can be
restricted to names containing specified substrings.
For example, if you want to see only the names of files containing COBOL
programs (i.e., ones with the suffix <tt>COB</tt>), you would enter
<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR *.COB</tt>

<p>
If you want to see only the names of subdirectories, you would enter
<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR *.DIR</tt>

<p>
To list the names of all files containing <tt>JUNK</tt> somewhere in 
the main part of the name, you would enter

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR *JUNK*.*</tt>

<p>
Let's say you want a listing of all files containing COBOL programs
in the subdirectory <tt>CMPS340</tt> of the default directory.
You would enter
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR [.CMPS340]*.COB</tt>

<p>
If you want more information about each listed file (such as size, creation
time, time of most recent modification, etc.), use the <tt>FULL</tt> 
qualifier, as in

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR/FULL</tt>

<p>
As it is likely that you are interested in seeing this information about
only one file, you would most likely enter something like

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DIR/FULL PROG1.COB</tt>

<p>
which would give you complete information regarding (the latest version
of) the file named <tt>PROG1.COB</tt>.

<p><br>
<b>Creation:</b>
<p>
To create a subdirectory called <tt>FRANK</tt> within the current directory,
enter 

<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> CREATE/DIR [.FRANK]</tt>

<hr>
<H3>Files</H3>

<p>
<b>Deleting Files:</b>
<p>
  Depending upon the settings chosen by the system administrator, VMS may
  save the last few versions of each file (rather than only the latest one).
  Different versions of the "same" file are distinguished by their version
  numbers.  Among two files with the same name, except for their version
  numbers, the one with the higher version number is the one more recently
  created.
<p>
  To delete all but the most recent version of each file in the default
  directory, enter the command
<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> PURGE</tt>

<p>
  To restrict purging to only those files whose names are of a certain form,
  enter, for example, 

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> PURGE *.COB</tt>

<p>
  which would purge only among files containing COBOL programs.

<p>
  To delete a particular file, you would enter, for example, 

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DELETE PROG1.COB;5</tt>

<p>
  Notice that the version number is required here!  To delete all versions
  of the file, you would enter

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DELETE PROG1.COB;*</tt>

<p>
  To delete all files containing COBOL programs (for example), enter

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DELETE *.COB;*</tt>

<p><br>
<b>Creating Files:</b>

<p>
  Occasionally, it may be convenient to create a new (and "empty") file.
  An example of doing that is

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> CREATE JUNK.TXT</tt>

<p>
At this point, you will be in edit mode (see <tt>EDIT</tt> command
below).  To escape from it, hit <tt>CNTRL-Z</tt>.

<p><br>
<b>Copying Files:</b>
<p>
To copy the contents of, say, the file <tt>JUNK.TXT</tt> into a new
file <tt>JUNK_OLD.TXT</tt>, enter

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> COPY JUNK.TXT JUNK_OLD.TXT</tt>

<p>As a special case of file copying, you can concatenate the contents
of two or more files, placing the result into another one, as follows
(for example):

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> COPY JUNK1.TXT JUNK2.TXT JUNK3.TXT 
     JUNK.TXT</tt>

<p>
which has the effect of creating <tt>JUNK.TXT</tt> and making its contents
be the concatenation of
<tt>JUNK1.TXT</tt>, <tt>JUNK2.TXT</tt>, and <tt>JUNK3.TXT</tt>.

<p>
If you want to append to an existing file the contents of one or more
other files, use <tt>APPEND</tt>, as in

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> APPEND JUNK1.TXT JUNK2.TXT JUNK3.TXT 
     JUNK.TXT</tt>

<p>
which has the effect of appending the contents of the first three files
mentioned onto the end of the fourth file mentioned.  (In other words,
the last file mentioned is the "destination".)
It is recommended that the destination file <!-- (above, <tt>JUNK.TXT</tt>) -->
<em>not</em> be among the "source" files, as you could get unexpected
results.

<p><br>
<b>Renaming</b>
<p>
To rename a file from, say, <tt>JUNK.TXT</tt> to <tt>GARBAGE.TXT</tt>,
you would enter the command
<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> RENAME JUNK.TXT GARBAGE.TXT</tt>

<p><br>
<b>Displaying Contents of Files:</b>

<p>
  To display the contents of a text file, enter something such as

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> TYPE PROG1.COB</tt>

<p>
  If you attempt to <tt>TYPE</tt> a non-text file, you will get garbage.
  (More precisely, the system will interpret the file's contents as though
  it were text.)

<p>
  To "dump" the (uninterpreted) contents of a file, enter something such as

<p>  
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> DUMP PROG1.COB</tt>

<p>
  This displays the contents of the file in hexadecimal form
  and as text, side by side.
  <!--, as well as textual (on the side). -->

<p><br>
<b>Editing Files:</b>

<p>  
At the moment, at least two text editors are available on
<tt>vaxsrv1.cs.uofs.edu</tt>, one of which is <tt>edit</tt>,
which is invoked as in the following:
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> EDIT PROG1.COB</tt>
<p>
This editor allows you to move around the screen with the arrow keys
and insert characters simply by typing.  To exit and save the file,
hit <tt>CNTRL-Z</tt>.  To quit without saving, hit <tt>CNTRL-Y</tt>.

<p>
However, we recommend that you use <tt>vim</tt>, which is a clone of
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/vi_instruct.txt"><tt>vi</tt></A>,
a popular editor on Unix systems.  An example of invocation is
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> VIM PROG1.COB</tt>

<!--
<p>
Replacing <tt>EDIT</tt> by <tt>LSE</tt> gives you the
"Language Sensitive Editor" and <tt>EDIT/EDT</tt> gives
you yet a different one.
-->

<hr>
<A Name="e-mail">
<H3>Sending E-mail</H3>
<p>
To send a file as e-mail, enter the command
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> MAIL/SUBJECT="&lt;subject line&gt;"
    &lt;file name&gt;  &lt;recipient username&gt;</tt>
<p>
For example, 
<p>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>$</b> MAIL/SUBJECT="program #1"
    prog1.cob  mccloske</tt>

<p>
Note that <tt>vaxsrv1.cs.uofs.edu</tt> supports only intra-system
e-mail.
