<h2>CMPS 340 Fall 2017<br />
HW#3: Relational Algebra Query Development<br />
Sample Solutions
</h2>

</p><p>
Using the COMPANY relational database from the Elmasri/Navathe textbook 
(the schema diagram of which, augmented with arrows showing
foreign keys, is in Figure 5.7 (7th edition, but 3.7 in 6th edition)
and a possible state of which is illustrated in 
<a href="../elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_3-6.pdf">Figure 5.6</a>
(3.6 in 6th edition),
<!-- (page 72)), --> 
devise Relational Algebra queries corresponding to the following 
"information requests".

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> 
Report the last name and department # of each employee whose 
first name is "Gourdhead" and whose salary is at least $70,000.
<!-- Report the first name and salary of each employee whose last name is
     "Gorn" and who works for either Department 1 or Department 5.
-->

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Dno
FROM RESTRICT Employee
     WHERE Fname = 'Gourdhead' AND Salary &gt;= 70000;</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>2.</b> 
Report the last name and birthdate of each male employee whose
middle initial is 'T' and who has a female dependent named 'Rumplestiltskin'.
<!-- 
  Report the last name and birthdate of each female employee whose
  salary is at least $60,000 and who works for a department named
  "Bureaucracy".
-->
</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT e.Lname, e.Bdate
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'M' AND Minit = 'T') AS e
     WITH (RESTRICT Dependent 
           WHERE Sex = 'F' AND Dependent_name = 'Rumplestiltskin')
     WHERE Ssn = Essn; </pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Report the first and last names of each employee who works on 
a project located in either Scranton or Wilkes-Barre.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>
PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM JOIN Employee
     WITH JOIN Works_On
          WITH (RESTRICT Project 
                WHERE Plocation = 'Scranton' OR Plocation = 'Wilkes-Barre'
               )
          WHERE Pno = Pnumber
     WHERE Ssn = Essn</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
Report the first and last names of each employee who works on 
a project located in Scranton but does not work on any
project located in Wilkes-Barre.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> The strategy here is to compute a table containing the
Ssn's of employees who work on a project in Scranton and another table
containing the Ssn's of employees who work on a project in Wilkes-Barre.
Then we subtract the latter from the former to obtain a table containing
the Ssn's of employees who work on a project in Scranton but do not work
on any project in Wilkes-Barre.  Having computed those Ssn's, it remains
to join with Employee to get the corresponding names.
<pre>
PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM Join Employee
     WITH (PROJECT Essn
           FROM JOIN Works_On
                WITH (RESTRICT Project WHERE Plocation = 'Scranton')
                WHERE Pno = Pnumber
          )
          MINUS
          (PROJECT Essn
           FROM JOIN Works_On
                WITH (RESTRICT Project WHERE Plocation = 'Wilkes-Barre')
                WHERE Pno = Pnumber
          )
     WHERE Ssn = Essn</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
Report the name and location of each department whose manager works 
for a different department.  (The department for which an employee
works is identified by the <tt>Dno</tt> attribute in the tuple
describing the employee.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> NAT_JOIN stands for "natural join".

<pre>PROJECT Dname, DLocation
FROM NAT_JOIN (JOIN Department 
               WITH Employee
               WHERE Dnumber &ne; Dno AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn
              )
     WITH Dept_Locations</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
Report, for each project, its name and number, 
the number of employees who work on it, 
and the sum of the hours that they work on it.
(Try to formulate your query so that the result explicitly 
identifies projects on which no employee is working.
Assume that the aggregate <tt>SUM</tt> function treats NULL as
though it were zero.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> LO_JOIN stands for "left outer join".
<pre>AGGREGATE Pname, Pnumber, COUNT(Essn), SUM(Hours)
FROM LO_JOIN Project
     WITH Works_On
     WHERE Pnumber = Pno
GROUP BY Pnumber</pre>

</p><p>
<b>Alternative Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Pname, Pnumber, EmpCount, SumHours
FROM LO_JOIN Project
     WITH (AGGREGATE COUNT(Essn) AS EmpCount, SUM(Hours) AS SumHours
           FROM Works_On
           GROUP BY Pno
          )
     WHERE Pnumber = Pno</pre>

</p><p>
The drawback of the alternative solution is that, in the table it produces,
tuples describing projects on which no employees work will have NULL "values"
in the <tt>EmpCount</tt> and <tt>SumHours</tt> columns rather than zeros.

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>7.</b>
Report, for each project and each of the two sexes, 
the number of the project, how many employees of that sex work
on that project, and the total number of hours that those employees
devote to that project.  (The resulting table should have attributes
for project number, sex, # of employees, and total hours.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Pno, Sex, COUNT(Essn), SUM(Hours)
FROM JOIN Employee
     WITH WITH Works_On
     WHERE Ssn = Essn
GROUP BY Pno, Sex</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>Bonus:</b> As above, but also include the project name in
each tuple and try to formulate your query so that the result 
explicitly identifies project/sex combinations for which the #
of employees is zero.
Assume that the aggregate <tt>SUM</tt> function treats NULL as
though it were zero.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> Forthcoming, one hopes

<!--
<pre>AGGREGATE Pnumber, Pname, Sex, COUNT(Essn), SUM(Hours)
FROM LO_JOIN Employee
     WITH LO_JOIN Project
          WITH Works_On
          WHERE Pnumber = Pno
     WHERE Ssn = Essn
GROUP BY Pnumber, Sex</pre>
