<h2>CMPS 340 Fall 2017 <br />
HW #1 Sample Solutions
</h2>

<b>1.</b> Solutions:
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(i)</em>: (M:N, total, partial)
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(ii)</em>: (1:N, partial, total)
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(iii)</em>: (1:1, partial, partial)
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(iv)</em>: (M:N, total, total)
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(v)</em>: (N:1, partial, partial)
<br /><b>(a)</b><em>(vi)</em>: (M:N, total, partial)

</p><p>
<b>(b)</b> One correct answer (among many) 
is the set A &times; {b<sub>1</sub>}, which in gory detail is
{(a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>),
  (a<sub>2</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>),
  (a<sub>3</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>)}

</p><p>
<b>(c)</b>
Consider any answer of the form <b>(x:1,y,total)</b>, 
where x is either "1" or "N" and y is either "total" or "partial".
(There are four such combinations, of course.)
Let R &sube; A&times;B be a relationship set consistent with such an answer.
There being four elements in B, and B's participation in R being
total, R must contain <b>at least four</b> ordered pairs.
<!--
  (a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>i</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>,b<sub>j</sub>),
  (a<sub>3</sub>,b<sub>k</sub>), and (a<sub>4</sub>,b<sub>m</sub>).
-->
</p><p>
In order for R to satisfy the x:1 cardinality constraint,
no member of A may appear in more than one of the ordered pairs in R.
There being three elements in A, R must contain <b>at most three</b> 
ordered pairs.
</p><p> 
But it is impossible for the number of pairs contained in R to be <b>both</b>
at least four <b>and</b> at most three.  Hence, such an R does not exist.
This covers four of the five impossible answers.

</p><p>
The remaining impossible answer is <b>(1:N,total,partial)</b>.
Let R &sube; A&times;B be a relationship set consistent with such an answer,
but not with a stronger answer.  (A stronger answer would be one in
which either the "N" was replaced by "1" or the "partial" was replaced
by "total", or both.)

</p><p>
Because of the "1" in the answer, no two ordered pairs of R can have
the same B-component. Because of the "partial", at least one member
of B must not appear in any ordered pair of R.
(If every member of B appeared in an ordered pair, the "partial" could
be strengthened to "total".)
Due to B having four members, it follows that R contains
<b>at most three</b> ordered pairs.

</p><p>
Because of the "total" in the answer, and the fact that A has three
members, R must have at least three members, with each a<sub>i</sub>
appearing in one.  But some a<sub>i</sub> must appear in at least
two ordered pairs, or else R would be consistent with an answer
in which the "N" were replaced by the stronger "1".  Thus, R must
contain <b>at least four</b> ordered pairs.

</p><p>
But it is impossible for the number of pairs contained in R to be <b>both</b>
at most three <b>and</b> at least four.  Hence, such an R does not exist.
