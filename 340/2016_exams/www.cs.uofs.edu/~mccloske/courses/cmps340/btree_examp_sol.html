B-tree Insertion/Deletion Examples, with Solutions<br>
</H2>

<!--

</p><p>
Consider the B-tree <tt>T</tt> of order 4 illustrated below.
(In order to keep the page from getting too wide, the nodes at
the leaf level appear to be on two different levels.)

</p><p>
For each operation in the list <b>(a)</b> through <b>(f)</b>,
we show the B-tree that results from performing that operation on T.
(Each operation is applied to the tree T illustrated below, 
<em>not</em> to the tree resulting from applying all the previous
operations to T.

</p><p>
We will perform each operation twice, once under the assumption that
<em>redistribution</em> is used only "when necessary" and then
under the assumption that it is used "whenever possible".

</p><p>
Redistribution never needs to occur as the result of an insertion,
as an overflowing node can always be split.  On the other hand, an
underflowing node cannot be merged with an adjacent sibling unless that
sibling is itself on the verge of underflowing (or almost so).
Hence, in order to maintain the property that every (non-root) node
is at least (roughly) half-full, redistribution sometimes must occur
as the result of a deletion.
<!-- False:   (Because of the small nature of our example, we will not
encounter such a situation.)
-->

</p><p>
In real-life, it may be practical for redistribution to involve
three or more contiguous siblings and their (common) parent.
Here, however, redistribution will be limited to involving only
<b>two</b> adjacent siblings and their parent.

</p><p>
Empirical and theoretical analysis indicates that you can expect a
B-tree in which redistribution occurs whenever possible to have
a <b>packing density</b> of about 85%, while one in which redistribution
occurs only when necessary will have a packing density of about 69%.

<b>(d)</b> To delete a key (here, 63) at an internal node,
first replace it with <em>x</em>, which can be either the largest key
in its left subtree (first case) (here, 61) 
or the smallest key in its right subtree (second case) (here 67).
Then delete <em>x</em> from the leaf at which we found it,
which we know how to do.  In either case, underflow results,
leading in the first case to redistribution (as a merge
is not possible) and in the second case to a merge.

<b>(e)</b> 
Insertion of 41 into the leaf containing 39, 44, and 48 results in
overflow.  Thus, the node is split, with 44 being promoted into the 
parent node containing 34, 50, and 58, which overflows as a consequence.
Hence, it splits as well, leading to the promotion of 50 to its parent
(the root), which overflows, resulting in it splitting, too!
In all cases, we promoted the third (of four) keys in an overflowing
node.  We could just as well have promoted the second key.

<b>(f)</b>
Deleting 96 causes underflow in the node from which it was deleted.
Because merging with its sibling is possible
(i.e., redistribution is not necessary), we do so,
resulting in the leaf node containing 98 99.
But this puts the node that had contained 98 in an underflowing
condition, and, because it can be merged with its sibling, we do so.

<b>(f)</b> 
Deleting 96 causes underflow in the node from which it was deleted.
Because there are no adjacent siblings that are not on the verge of
underflowing, merging is performed, resulting in the leaf node
containing 98 99.  But this leaves the node that had contained 98 in
an underflowing condition, and so redistribution with its only sibling
is performed.
