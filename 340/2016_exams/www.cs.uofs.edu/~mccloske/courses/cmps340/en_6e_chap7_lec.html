<H2>Notes on Chapter 7 (of 6th edition, Chapter 3 of older editions)
   of Elmasri &amp; Navathe:
   Data Modeling Using the Entity-Relationship Model </H2>



<H3>Outline of Database Design</H3>
<p>
The main phases of database design are depicted in Figure 7.1 (page 201):
<!--page 59:-->

<ul>
  <li><b>Requirements Collection and Analysis</b>: purpose is to produce
      a description of the users' requirements.
  </li>
  <li><b>Conceptual Design</b>:  purpose is to produce a 
      <em>conceptual schema</em> for the database, including detailed
      descriptions of <em>entity types</em>, <em>relationship types</em>,
      and <em>constraints</em>.  All these are expressed in terms provided
      by the data model being used.
      (<em>Remark</em>: As the ER model is focused on precisely these
       three concepts, it would seem that the authors are predisposed to
       using that data model!)
  </li>
  <li><b>Implementation</b>: purpose is to transform the conceptual schema
      (which is at a high/abstract level) into a (lower-level) 
      <em>representational/implementational</em> model supported by
      whatever DBMS is to be used.
  </li>
  <li><b>Physical Design</b>: purpose is to decide upon the
      internal storage structures, access paths (indexes), etc.,
      that will be used in realizing the representational model
      produced in previous phase.
  </li>
</ul>


<hr>
<H3>7.3: Entity-Relationship (ER) Model</H3>
<p>
Our focus now is on the second phase, <b>conceptual design</b>,
for which The <b>Entity-Relationship (ER) Model</b> (introduced by
Chen in 1976) is a popular high-level conceptual data model.

<p>
In the ER model, the main concepts are <b>entity</b>, <b>attribute</b>,
and <b>relationship</b>.

<H3>7.3.1 Entities and Attributes</H3>
<p>
<b>Entity</b>:  
  An entity represents some "thing" (in the miniworld) that is of 
  interest to us, i.e., about which we want to maintain some data.
  An entity could represent a physical object (e.g., house, person,
  automobile, widget) or a less tangible concept (e.g., company, job,
  academic course, business transaction).

<p>
<b>Attribute</b>: An entity is described by its attributes, which are
  properties characterizing it.  Each attribute has a <b>value</b>
  drawn from some <b>domain</b> (set of meaningful values).

<p>
Example: A <em>PERSON</em> entity might be described by <em>Name</em>,
<em>BirthDate</em>, <em>Sex</em>, etc., attributes, each having a particular
value.

<p>
What distinguishes an entity from an attribute is that the latter is
strictly for the purpose of describing the former and is not, in and
of itself, of interest to us.  It is sometimes said that an entity
has an independent existence, whereas an attribute does not.
In performing data modeling, however, it is not always clear whether
a particular concept deserves to be classified as an entity or "only"
as an attribute.

<p>
We can classify attributes along these dimensions:
<ul>
  <li>simple/atomic  vs. composite</li>
  <li>single-valued vs. multi-valued (or set-valued)</li>
  <li>stored vs. derived  (<em>Note from instructor:</em> this seems like an
           implementational detail that ought not be considered at
           this (high) level of abstraction.)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
A <b>composite</b> attribute is one that is <em>composed</em> of smaller parts.
An <b>atomic</b> attribute is indivisible or indecomposable.
<ul>
  <li><b>Example 1</b>: A <em>BirthDate</em> attribute can be viewed as being 
      composed of (sub-)attributes <em>month</em>, <em>day</em>, and 
      <em>year</em> (each of which would probably be viewed as being atomic).
  </li>
  <li><b>Example 2</b>: An <em>Address</em> attribute (Figure 7.4, page 205)
      <!--64-->
      can be viewed as being composed of (sub-)attributes for street address,
      city, state, and zip code. 
      A street address can itself be viewed as being composed of
      a number, street name, and apartment number. 
      As this suggests, composition can extend to a depth of two
      (as here) or more.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
To describe the structure of a composite attribute, one can draw
a tree (as in the aforementioned Figure 7.4).   In case we are
limited to using text, it is customary to write its name followed
by a parenthesized list of its sub-attributes.
For the examples mentioned above, we would write 

<p>
<center><em>BirthDate(Month, Day, Year)</em><br>
   <em>Address(StreetAddr(StrNum, StrName, AptNum), City, State, Zip)</em>
</center>

<p>
<b>Single- vs. multi-valued</b> attribute:  Consider a <em>PERSON</em> entity.
The person it represents has (one) <em>SSN</em>, (one) <em>date of birth</em>,
(one, although composite) <em>name</em>, etc.
But that person may have zero or more academic degrees, dependents, or
(if the person is a male living in Utah) spouses!  
How can we model this via attributes <em>AcademicDegrees</em>, 
<em>Dependents</em>, and <em>Spouses</em>?
One way is to allow such attributes to be <em>multi-valued</em>
(perhaps <em>set-valued</em> is a better term),
which is to say that we assign to them a (possibly empty) <em>set</em>
of values rather than a single value.

<p>
To distinguish a multi-valued attribute from a single-valued one,
it is customary to enclose the former within curly braces (which makes
sense, as such an attribute has a value that is a set, and curly braces
are traditionally used to denote sets).
Using the <em>PERSON</em> example from above, we would depict its structure
in text as
<p>
<center><em>PERSON(SSN, Name, BirthDate(Month, Day, Year),
    { AcademicDegrees(School, Level, Year) }, { Dependents }, ...)</em>
</center>

<p>
Here we have taken the liberty to assume that each academic degree is
described by a school, level (e.g., H.S., B.S., Ph.D.), and year.
Thus, <em>AcademicDegrees</em> is not only multi-valued but also
composite.  We refer to an attribute that involves some combination of
multi-valuedness <em>and</em> compositeness as a <b>complex</b> attribute.

<p>
A more complicated example of a complex attribute is <em>AddressPhone</em>
in Figure 7.5 (page 207). <!--(page 65).-->  This attribute is for recording
data regarding addresses and phone numbers of a business.
The structure of this attribute allows for the business to have
several offices, each described by an address and 
a set of phone numbers that ring into that office.
Its structure is given by
<p>
<center><em>{ AddressPhone( { Phone(AreaCode, Number) },
         Address(StrAddr(StrNum, StrName, AptNum), City, State, Zip)) }
</em>
</center>


<p>
<b>Stored vs. derived</b> attribute: 
   Perhaps <em>independent</em> and <em>derivable</em> would be
   better terms for these (or <em>non-redundant</em> and <em>redundant</em>).
   In any case, a <em>derived</em> attribute is one whose value can be
   calculated from the values of other attributes, and hence need not be
   stored.
   <b>Examples:</b> <em>Age</em> can be calculated from <em>BirthDate</em>,
   assuming that the current date is accessible.  <em>GPA</em> can be
   calculated, assuming that the necessary data regarding courses and
   grades is accessible.

<p>
<b>The Null value</b>: In some cases a particular entity might not have an
applicable value for a particular attribute.
Or that value may be unknown.
<!-- Or, in the case of a multi-valued attribute, the appropriate
     value might be the empty set.  (So then why not empty set as a value???)
-->
<p>
<em>Example</em>: The attribute <em>DateOfDeath</em> is not applicable
to a living person and its correct value may be unknown for some
persons who have died.

<p>
In such cases, we use a special attribute value (non-value?), 
called <b>null</b>.
There has been some argument among database experts
about whether a different approach (such as having distinct values for
<em>not applicable</em> and <em>unknown</em>) would be superior.


<hr>
<H3>7.3.2: Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Domains (Value Sets)</H3>

<p>
Above we mentioned the concept of a <em>PERSON</em> entity,
i.e., a representation of a particular person via the use of attributes
such as <em>Name</em>, <em>Sex</em>, etc.  
As a general rule, for each entity type there will be multiple (perhaps
even thousands or millions of) entities of that type about which we want
to store data in the database, each of them described by the same
collection of attributes.  Of course, the <em>values</em> of those
attributes will differ from one entity to another (e.g., one person will
have the name "Mary" and another will have the name "Rumpelstiltskin").
Just as likely is that we will want our database to store information
about other kinds of entities, such as business transactions or academic
courses, which will be described by entirely different collections of
attributes.

<p>
This illustrates the distinction between entity types and
entity instances.
An <b>entity type</b> serves as a template for a collection of 
<b>entity instances</b>, all of which are described by the same
collection of attributes.
That is, an entity type is analogous to a <b>class</b> in object-oriented
programming and an entity instance is analogous to a particular object
(i.e., instance of a class).  (Or, even simpler, an entity type and
instance, respectively, are analogous to a data type (e.g., integer) and
a value of that type (e.g., 57).)


<p>
In ER modeling, we deal only with entity types, not with instances.
In an ER diagram, each entity type is denoted by a rectangular box.

<p>
An <b>entity set</b> is the collection of all entities of a particular
type that exist, in a database, at some moment in time.

<p>
<b>Key Attributes of an Entity Type</b>:
A minimal collection of attributes
(often only one) that, by design, distinguishes any two
(simultaneously-existing) entities of that type.
In other words, if attributes <em>A<sub>1</sub></em>
through <em>A<sub>m</sub></em> together form a key of
entity type <em>E</em>, and <em>e</em> and <em>f</em> are
two entities of type <em>E</em> existing at the same time,
then, in at least one of the attributes <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> 
(<em>0 &lt; i &lt;= m</em>), <em>e</em> and <em>f</em> must have
distinct values.
<p>
An entity type could have more than one key.
(An example of this appears in Figure 7.7, page 207<!--67-->, in which the
<tt>CAR</tt> entity type is postulated to have both
{ <em>Registration(RegistrationNum, State)</em> } and
{ <em>VehicleID</em> } as keys.)

<p>
<b>Domains (Value Sets)</b> of Attributes: The domain of an attribute
is the "universe of values" from which its value can be drawn.
In other words, an attribute's domain specifies its set of allowable
values.  The concept is similar to <b>data type</b>.


<hr>
<H3>Example Database Application: COMPANY</H3> 

<p>
Suppose that Requirements Collection and Analysis results in the
following (informal) description of the COMPANY miniworld:
<p>
The company is organized as a collection of <b>departments</b>.
<ul>
  <li>Each department 
    <ul>
      <li>has a unique name</li>
      <li>has a unique number</li>
      <li>is associated with a set of locations</li>
      <li>has a particular employee who acts as its manager
          (and who assumed that position on some date)
      </li>
      <li>has a set of employees assigned to it</li>
      <li>controls a set of projects</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each project 
    <ul>
      <li>has a unique name</li>
      <li>has a unique number</li>
      <li>has a single location</li>
      <li>has a set of employees who work on it</li>
      <li>is controlled by a single department</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each employee
    <ul>
      <li>has a name</li>
      <li>has a SSN that uniquely identifies her/him</li>
      <li>has an address</li>
      <li>has a salary</li>
      <li>has a sex</li>
      <li>has a birthdate</li>
      <li>has a direct supervisor</li>
      <li>has a set of dependents</li>
      <li>is assigned to one department</li>
      <li>works some number of hours per week on each of a set of 
          projects (which need not all be controlled by the same department)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Each dependent 
    <ul>
      <li>has first name</li>
      <li>has a sex</li>
      <li>has a birthdate</li>
      <li>is related to a particular employee in a particular way
          (e.g., child, spouse, pet)
      </li>
      <li>is uniquely identified by the combination of her/his
          first name and the employee of which (s)he is a dependent
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h3>7.3.3 Initial Conceptual Design of COMPANY database</H3>

<p>
Using the above structured description as a guide, we get the following
preliminary design for entity types and their attributes in the
COMPANY database:
<ul>
  <li>DEPARTMENT(<u>Name</u>, <u>Number</u>, { Locations }, 
      Manager, ManagerStartDate, { Employees }, { Projects })
  </li>
  <li>PROJECT(<u>Name</u>, <u>Number</u>, Location, { Workers },
      ControllingDept)
  </li>
  <li>EMPLOYEE(Name(FName, MInit, LName), <u>SSN</u>, Sex, Address,
         Salary, BirthDate, Dept, Supervisor, 
         { Dependents }, { WorksOn(Project, Hours) })
  </li>
  <li>DEPENDENT(<u>Employee, FirstName</u>, Sex, BirthDate, Relationship)
  </li>
  </li>
</ul>
(A diagrammatic version of this appears in Figure 7.8, page 211.
(Note that the set-valued attributes Employees and Projects are absent 
from the DEPARTMENT entity type and set-valued attribute Workers is absent
from the PROJECT entity type.)
&nbsp <a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-8.pdf">pdf</a>
&nbsp <a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-8.tif">tiff</a>)

<p>
<em>Remarks</em>: Note that the attribute <em>WorksOn</em> of EMPLOYEE
   (which records on which projects the employee works) is not only
   set-valued (because there may be several such projects) but also
   composite, because we want to record, for each such project, the
   number of hours per week that the employee works on it.
   Also, each <em>candidate key</em> has been indicated by underlining it.
<p>
   For similar reasons, the attributes <em>Manager</em> and
   <em>ManagerStartDate</em> of DEPARTMENT really ought to be combined
   into a single composite attribute.  Not doing so causes little or no
   harm, however, because these are single-valued attributes.
   Multi-valued attributes would pose some difficulties, on the other
   hand.  Suppose, for example, that a department could have two or more
   managers, and that some department had managers Mary and Harry, whose
   start dates were 10-4-1999 and 1-13-2001, respectively.  Then the
   values of the <em>Manager</em> and <em>ManagerStartDate</em> attributes
   should be <em>{ Mary, Harry }</em> and <em>{ 10-4-1999, 1-13-2001 }</em>.
   But from these two attribute values, there is no way to determine which
   manager started on which date.
   <!--
   As both of these are sets, we could say, equivalently, that the value of
   the <em>Manager</em> attribute should be <em>{ Harry, Mary }</em>.
   What this illustrates is that knowing the set of managers and the
   set of dates on which they became managers does not allow us to determine
   which manager started on which date!
   -->
   On the other hand, by recording this data as a set of ordered pairs,
   in which each pair identifies a manager and her/his starting date,
   this deficiency is eliminated.
<em>End of Remarks</em>

<hr>
<p>
<H3>7.4 Relationship Types, Sets, Roles, and Structural Constraints</H3>

<p>
Having presented a preliminary database schema for COMPANY,
it is now convenient to clarify the concept of a <b>relationship</b>
(which is the last of the three main concepts involved in the ER model).

<p>
<b>Relationship</b>: This is an association between two entities.
As an example, one can imagine a <tt>STUDENT</tt> entity being
associated to an <tt>ACADEMIC_COURSE</tt> entity via, say, an
<tt>ENROLLED_IN</tt> relationship.

<p>
Whenever an attribute of one entity type refers to
an entity (of the same or of a different entity type), we
say that a relationship exists between the two entity types.

<p>
From our preliminary COMPANY schema, we identify the following
<b>relationship types</b> (using descriptive names and ordering the
participating entity types so that the resulting phrase will be
in active voice rather than passive):
<ul>
  <li>EMPLOYEE &nbsp;<tt>MANAGES</tt>&nbsp; DEPARTMENT 
      (arising from <em>Manager</em> attribute in DEPARTMENT)
  </li>
  <li>DEPARTMENT &nbsp;<tt>CONTROLS</tt>&nbsp; PROJECT
      (arising from <em>ControllingDept</em> attribute in PROJECT
      and the <em>Projects</em> attribute in DEPARTMENT)
  </li>
  <li>EMPLOYEE &nbsp;<tt>WORKS_FOR</tt>&nbsp; DEPARTMENT
      (arising from <em>Dept</em> attribute in EMPLOYEE and
      the <em>Employees</em> attribute in DEPARTMENT)
  </li>
  <li>EMPLOYEE &nbsp;<tt>SUPERVISES</tt>&nbsp; EMPLOYEE
      (arising from <em>Supervisor</em> attribute in EMPLOYEE)
  </li>
  <li>EMPLOYEE &nbsp;<tt>WORKS_ON</tt>&nbsp; PROJECT
      (arising from <em>WorksOn</em> attribute in EMPLOYEE and
      the <em>Workers</em> attribute in PROJECT)
  </li>
  <li>DEPENDENT &nbsp;<tt>DEPENDS_ON</tt>&nbsp; EMPLOYEE
      (arising from <em>Employee</em> attribute in DEPENDENT and the
      <em>Dependents</em> attribute in EMPLOYEE)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In ER diagrams, relationship types are drawn as diamond-shaped boxes
connected by lines to the entity types involved.  See Figure 7.2, 
page 204<!--62-->.  Note that attributes are depicted by ovals connected by
lines to the entity types they describe (with multi-valued attributes
in double ovals and composite attributes depicted by trees).
The original attributes that gave rise to the
relationship types are absent, having been replaced by the
relationship types.

<p>
A <b>relationship set</b> is a set of instances of a relationship type.
If, say, <tt>R</tt> is a relationship type that relates entity types
<tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt>, then, at any moment in time, the
relationship set of <tt>R</tt> will be a set of ordered pairs
<em>(x,y)</em>, where <em>x</em> is an instance of <tt>A</tt> and
<em>y</em> is an instance of <tt>B</tt>.
What this means is that, for example, if our COMPANY miniworld is,
at some moment, such that employees
<em>e<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>e<sub>3</sub></em>, and <em>e<sub>6</sub></em>
work for department <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>, employees
<em>e<sub>2</sub></em> and <em>e<sub>4</sub></em>
work for department <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>, and employees
<em>e<sub>5</sub></em> and <em>e<sub>7</sub></em>
work for department <em>d<sub>3</sub></em>,
<!--
 <em>e<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>e<sub>2</sub></em>,
<em>e<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>e<sub>4</sub></em>,
<em>e<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>e<sub>6</sub></em>, and
<em>e<sub>7</sub></em> work for departments
<em>d<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>,
<em>d<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>,
and <em>d<sub>3</sub></em>, respectively,
-->
then the <tt>WORKS_FOR</tt>
<b>relationship set</b> will include as <b>instances</b> the ordered pairs
(<em>e<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub></em>),
(<em>e<sub>2</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>2</sub>)</em>,
(<em>e<sub>3</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub>)</em>, 
(<em>e<sub>4</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>2</sub>)</em>,
(<em>e<sub>5</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>3</sub>)</em>,
(<em>e<sub>6</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>1</sub>)</em>, and
(<em>e<sub>7</sub></em>, <em>d<sub>3</sub>)</em>.
See Figure 7.9 on page 213<!--71--> for a graphical depiction of this.

<p>
<b>Ordering of entity types in relationship types</b>:
Note that the order in which we list the entity types in describing
a relationship is of little consequence, except that the
relationship name (for purposes of clarity) ought to be consistent
with it.  For example, if we swap the two entity types in each
of the first two relationships listed above, we should rename
them <tt>IS_MANAGED_BY</tt> and <tt>IS_CONTROLLED_BY</tt>, respectively.

<p>
<b>7.4.2 Degree of a relationship type</b>:
Also note that, in our COMPANY example, all relationship instances will
be ordered pairs, as each relationship associates an instance from
one entity type with an instance of another (or the same, in the case
of <tt>SUPERVISES</tt>) entity type.  Such relationships are
said to be <em>binary</em>, or to have <em>degree</em> two.
Relationships with degree three (called <em>ternary</em>) or more
are also possible, but they do not arise as often in practice.
This is illustrated in Figure 7.10 (page 214<!--72-->),
where a relationship <tt>SUPPLY</tt>
(perhaps not the best choice for a name) has as instances ordered
triples of suppliers, parts, and projects, with the intent being
that inclusion of the ordered triple 
<em>(s<sub>2</sub>, p<sub>4</sub>, j<sub>1</sub>)</em>, for
example, indicates that
supplier <em>s<sub>2</sub></em> supplied part <em>p<sub>4</sub></em>
to project <em>j<sub>1</sub>)</em>.

<p>
<b>Roles in relationships</b>:
Each entity that participates in a relationship plays a particular
<em>role</em> in that relationship, and it is often convenient to
refer to that role using an appropriate name.
For example, in each instance of a <tt>WORKS_FOR</tt> relationship set,
the employee entity plays the role of <em>worker</em> or
(surprise!) <em>employee</em> and
each department plays the role of <em>employer</em> or (surprise!)
<em>department</em>.  Indeed, as this example suggests, often it
is best to use the same name for the role as for the corresponding
entity type.

<p>
An exception to this rule occurs when the same entity type plays two
(or more) roles in the same relationship.
(Such relationships are said to be <em>reCURsive</em>, which I
find to be a misleading use of that term.  A better term might be
<em>self-referential</em>.)
For example, in each instance of a <tt>SUPERVISES</tt> relationship set,
one employee plays the role of <em>supervisor</em> and the other plays
the role of <em>supervisee</em>.

<p>
<b>7.4.3 Constraints on Binary Relationship Types</b>
<p>
Often, in order to make a relationship type be an accurate model
of the miniworld concepts that it is intended to represent, we
impose certain constraints that limit the possible corresponding
relationship sets.  (That is, a constraint may make "invalid" a
particular set of instances for a relationship type.)

<p>
There are two main kinds of relationship constraints
(on binary relationships).
For illustration, let <em>R</em> be a relationship set consisting of
ordered pairs of instances of entity types <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>,
respectively.
<ul>
  <li><b>cardinality ratio</b>: 
      <ul>
        <p>
        <li><b>1:1 (one-to-one)</b>:
            Under this constraint, no instance of <em>A</em> may particpate
            in more than one instance of <em>R</em>; 
            similarly for instances of <em>B</em>.
            In other words, if <em>(a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>)</em> and
            <em>(a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>)</em> are (distinct)
            instances of <em>R</em>, then neither
            <em>a<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>2</sub></em> nor
            <em>b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>2</sub></em>.
            <br><b>Example</b>: Our informal description of COMPANY says
            that every department has one employee who manages it.
            If we also stipulate that an employee may not (simultaneously)
            play the role of manager for more than one department,
            it follows that <tt>MANAGES</tt> is 1:1.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li><b>1:N (one-to-many)</b>:
            Under this constraint, no instance of <em>B</em> may participate
            in more than one instance of <em>R</em>, but instances of
            <em>A</em> are under no such restriction.
            In other words, if <em>(a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>)</em> and
            <em>(a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>)</em> are (distinct)
            instances of <em>R</em>, then it cannot be the case that
            <em>b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>2</sub></em>.
            <br><b>Example</b>: <tt>CONTROLS</tt> is 1:N because
            no project may be controlled by more than one department.
            On the other hand, a department may control any number of
            projects, so there is no restriction on the number of
            relationship instances in which a particular
            department instance may participate.
            For similar reasons, <tt>SUPERVISES</tt> is also 1:N.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li><b>N:1 (many-to-one)</b>:
            This is just the same as 1:N but with roles of the two
            entity types reversed.
            <br><b>Example</b>: <tt>WORKS_FOR</tt> and <tt>DEPENDS_ON</tt>
            are N:1.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li><b>M:N (many-to-many)</b>:
            Under this constraint, there are no restrictions.
            (Hence, the term applies to the absence of a constraint!)
            <br><b>Example</b>: <tt>WORKS_ON</tt> is M:N, because an
            employee may work on any number of projects and a
            project may have any number of employees who work on it.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  Notice the notation in Figure 7.2 (page 204) for indicating each
  relationship type's cardinality ratio.  

  <p>
  Suppose that, in designing a database, we decide to include a
  binary relationship <em>R</em>, as described above, that relates
  entity types <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, respectively.
  To determine how <em>R</em> should be constrained, with respect to 
  cardinality ratio, the questions you should ask are these:
  <p>
    <center>
    May a given entity of type B be related to multiple entities of type A?
    <br /> 
    May a given entity of type A be related to multiple entities of type B?
    </center>
  <p>
  The pair of answers you get maps into the four possible cardinality ratios
  as follows:
  <p><center>
   (yes, yes) &xrarr;   M:N<br />
   (yes, no)  &xrarr;  N:1<br />
   (no, yes)  &xrarr;  1:N<br />
   (no, no)   &xrarr;  1:1</br />
  </center>
  <p>

  <li><b>participation</b>: specifies whether or not the existence of an
      entity depends upon its being related to another entity via
      the relationship.
      <ul>
        <p>
        <li><b>total participation (or existence dependency)</b>:
            To say that entity type <em>A</em> is constrained to
            <b>participate totally</b> in relationship <em>R</em> is to
            say that if (at some moment in time) <em>R</em>'s instance set is
            <p><center>
            <em>{ (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>),
                  (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ...
                  (a<sub>m</sub>, b<sub>m</sub>) }</em>,
            </center><br>
            then (at that same moment) <em>A</em>'s instance set must be
            <em>{ a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>m</sub> }</em>.
            In other words, there can be no member of <em>A</em>'s instance
            set that does not participate in at least one instance of
            <em>R</em>.
       
            <p>
            According to our informal description of COMPANY, every
            employee must be assigned to some department.
            That is, every employee instance must
            participate in at least one instance of <tt>WORKS_FOR</tt>,
            which is to say that <em>EMPLOYEE</em> satisfies the
            total participation constraint
            with respect to the <tt>WORKS_FOR</tt> relationship.
            <p>
            In an ER diagram, if entity type <em>A</em> must participate
            totally in relationship type <tt>R</tt>, the two are connected
            by a double line.  See Figure 7.2, page 204.
        </li>
        <p>
        <li><b>partial participation</b>:
            the absence of the total participation constraint!
            (E.g., not every employee has to participate in <tt>MANAGES</tt>;
            hence we say that, with respect to <tt>MANAGES</tt>,
            <em>EMPLOYEE</em> participates partially.  This is not to say
            that for all employees to be managers is not allowed; it only
            says that it need not be the case that all employees are
            managers.
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>7.4.4 Attributes of Relationship Types</b> (page 218<!--76-->)
<p>
Relationship types, like entity types, can have attributes.
A good example is <tt>WORKS_ON</tt>, each instance of which
identifies an employee and a project on which (s)he works.
In order to record (as the specifications indicate) how many
hours are worked by each employee on each project, we include
<em>Hours</em> as an attribute of <tt>WORKS_ON</tt>.  (See
Figure 7.2 again.)
In the case of an M:N relationship type (such as <tt>WORKS_ON</tt>),
allowing attributes is vital.  In the case of an N:1, 1:N, or
1:1 relationship type, any attributes can be assigned to the
entity type opposite from the 1 side.  For example, the
<em>StartDate</em> attribute of the <tt>MANAGES</tt> relationship type
can be given to either the <em>EMPLOYEE</em> or the <em>DEPARTMENT</em>
entity type. 

<hr>
<p>
<b>7.5 Weak Entity Types</b>:
An entity type that has no set of attributes that qualify as a key
is called <b>weak</b>.
(Ones that do are <b>strong</b>.)

<p>
An entity of a weak identity type is uniquely identified by the
specific entity to which it is related (by a so-called
<b>identifying relationship</b> that relates the weak entity type
with its so-called <b>identifying</b> or <b>owner entity type</b>)
in combination with some set of its own attributes
(called a <em>partial key</em>).

<p>
<b>Example</b>: A <em>DEPENDENT</em> entity is identified by its first name
together with the <em>EMPLOYEE</em> entity to which it is related via
<tt>DEPENDS_ON</tt>.  (Note that this wouldn't work for former
heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman's sons,
as they all have the name "George"!)

<p>
Because an entity of a weak entity type cannot be identified otherwise,
that type has a <b>total participation constraint</b>
(i.e., <b>existence dependency</b>) with respect to the identifying
relationship.

<p>
This should not be taken to mean that any entity type on which a
total participation constraint exists is weak.  For example,
DEPARTMENT has a total participation constraint with respect to
<tt>MANAGES</tt>, but it is not weak.

<p>
In an ER diagram, a weak entity type is depicted with a double rectangle
and an identifying relationship type is depicted with a double diamond.
<p>
<b>Design Choices for ER Conceptual Design</b>:
Sometimes it is not clear whether a particular miniworld concept ought to be
modeled as an entity type, an attribute, or a relationship type.
Here are some guidelines (given with the understanding that 
schema design is an iterative process in which an initial design
is refined repeatedly until a satisfactory result is achieved):
<ul>
  <li>As happened in our development of the ER model for COMPANY,
      if an attribute of entity type <em>A</em> serves as a reference
      to an entity of type <em>B</em>, it may be wise to refine that
      attribute into a binary relationship involving entity types
      <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>.  It may well be that <em>B</em>
      has a corresponding attribute referring back to <em>A</em>,
      in which case it, too, is refined into the aforementioned
      relationship.  In our COMPANY example, this was exemplified by
      the <em>Projects</em> and <em>ControllingDept</em> attributes
      of <em>DEPARTMENT</em> and <em>PROJECT</em>, respectively.
  </li>
  <li>An attribute that exists in several entity types may be refined
      into its own entity type.  For example, suppose that in a
      UNIVERSITY database we have entity types <em>STUDENT</em>,
      <em>INSTRUCTOR</em>, and <em>COURSE</em>, all of which have a
      <em>Department</em> attribute.  Then it may be wise to introduce
      a new entity type, <em>DEPARTMENT</em>, and then to follow the
      preceding guideline by introducing a binary relationship between
      <em>DEPARTMENT</em> and each of the three aforementioned entity types.
  </li>
  <li>An entity type that is involved in very few relationships
      (say, zero, one, or possibly two) could be refined into an attribute
      (of each entity type to which it is related).
  </li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>
<b>7.6 Refining the ER Design for the COMPANY Database</b>:
<p>
This refers to what has, in effect, been described above, which
is to take the preliminary design in Figure 7.8 (page 211) and
to refine it into the ER Diagram in Figure 7.2
(<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-2.pdf">pdf</a> &nbsp;
<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-2.tif">tiff</a>).
This is accomplished by converting into a <em>relationship type</em>
each attribute that represents a relationship and to indicate, for
each relationship type, whatever cardinality and participation constraints
are appropriate for it.
</p><p>
A slightly different ER Diagram notation (from Abrial) that provides
a little more specificity as to cardinality ratio constraints, is
shown in Figure 7.15 
(<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-15.pdf">pdf</a> &nbsp;
<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-15.tif">tiff</a>).

This section discusses our choice of names for the entity and
relationship types in our ER Diagram (in Figure 7.2) depicting
the COMPANY database.  It also discusses the diagrammatic features
of the ER Modeling "language" (see Figure 7.14, page 223).
