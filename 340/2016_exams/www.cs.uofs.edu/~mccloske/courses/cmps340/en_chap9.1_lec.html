<H2>Notes on Section 9.1 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe:
    Mapping an ER Schema to a Relational Database Schema </H2>

<b>STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION</b>

<p>
Here we illustrate the 7-step procedure for deriving a
relational database schema from an ER schema diagram
(as described in Section 9.1 of E&amp;N) by applying it to the
<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_7-2.pdf" target="_blank">COMPANY 
ER schema</a> obtained in Chapter 7.
(It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the
<b>relational data model</b>, the main concepts of which include
<b>relation</b>, <b>tuple</b>, and <b>attribute</b> (or their loose
equivalents, <b>table</b>, <b>row</b>, and <b>column</b>, respectively).
See Chapter 3 of E&amp;N (Chap. 7 in older editions of the book) 
and/or the relevant web page.)

<H3>Step 1: Strong Entity Types</H3>

</p><p>
For each regular (i.e., strong, non-weak) entity type <em>E</em> in the
ER schema, create a relation <b>E</b>.
For each single-valued attribute <em>A</em> of <em>E</em> having no 
multi-valued sub-attributes, make all its atomic sub-attributes
(including only <em>A</em> itself, if it is atomic) be attributes
of <b>E</b>.

</p><p>
Choose as the primary key of <b>E</b> the collection of attributes
arising from some key of <em>E</em>.

</p><p>
In the COMPANY example (using Figure 7.2 (3.2 in older editions)),
this step leads us to the following (partial) relational schema:
<ul>
  <li><b>EMPLOYEE</b>(<em><u>SSN</u>, Fname, Minit, Lname, Bdate, Sex,
       Address, Salary</em>)
  </li>
  <li><b>DEPARTMENT</b>(<em><u>Number</u>, Name</em>)</li>
  <li><b>PROJECT</b>(<em><u>Number</u>, Name, Location</em>)</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Notice that (composite) <em>Name</em> attribute of the <em>EMPLOYEE</em>
entity type gives rise to three attributes in the relation
<b>EMPLOYEE</b>, corresponding to its three atomic sub-attributes.

</p><p>
We arbitrarily chose <em>Number</em> as the primary key for both
<b>DEPARTMENT</b> and <b>PROJECT</b>, 
although we could have chosen <em>Name</em> for either one.
(According to Figure 7.2 (3.2 in older editions),
both attributes (individually, that is) are keys
of the corresponding entity types.)


<H3>Step 2: Weak Entity Types</H3>
<p>
For each weak entity type <em>W</em> in the ER schema,
create a relation <b>W</b>.  As in Step 1, for each single-valued
attribute of <em>W</em> having no multi-valued sub-attributes,
make all its atomic sub-attributes be attributes of <b>W</b>.

</p><p>
Let <em>E</em>, with corresponding relation <b>E</b>,
be an <b>owner entity type</b> of <em>W</em>. 
Add as (<b>foreign key</b>) attributes of <b>W</b> the attributes
forming the primary key of <b>E</b>.  (These attributes can be
renamed, if desired.)
</p><p>
The primary key of <b>W</b> includes all the foreign key attributes
added as a result of the previous paragraph, plus any partial key
attributes of weak entity type <em>W</em>.

</p><p>
For the COMPANY example, this step results in the introduction of
relation <b>DEPENDENT</b>, which includes as attributes all those associated
with weak entity type <em>DEPENDENT</em> in Figure 7.2 (3.2 in older editions),
plus the primary key <em>SSN</em> (renamed <em>ESSN</em>) of the relation
<b>EMPLOYEE</b> (which arose from owner entity type <em>EMPLOYEE</em>).
The primary key of <b>DEPENDENT</b> is the partial key <em>Name</em> in
combination with the foreign key, <em>ESSN</em>.

</p><p>
We add the following to our relational schema:
<ul>
  <li><b>DEPENDENT</b>(<em><u>ESSN, Name</u>, Sex, Birthdate,
       Relationship</em>)</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> It is possible for a weak entity type <em>W<sub>1</sub></em>
to have an owner entity type <em>W<sub>2</sub></em> that is itself weak.
In that case, the introduction of relation <b>W<sub>2</sub></b> should
occur before that of <b>W<sub>1</sub></b> in order to ensure that the
attributes forming the primary key of <b>W<sub>1</sub></b> can be
ascertained when it is introduced.
<b>End of note.</b>

<H3>Step 3: 1:1 Relationships</H3>
</p><p>
For each binary 1:1 relationship type <tt>R</tt> with participating
entity types <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, choose one of the corresponding
relations, say <b>S</b>, and include as a foreign key in <b>S</b>
the attribute(s) forming the primary key of <b>T</b>.
(<em>Note</em>: If possible, the role of <em>S</em> should be played by
an entity type constrained to participate totally in <tt>R</tt>.
Include as attributes of <b>S</b>, in addition, all atomic sub-attributes
of any attributes of <tt>R</tt> not involving multi-valuedness.
</p><p>
With respect to COMPANY, consider the <tt>MANAGES</tt> relationship, which
is 1:1.  Among its participating entity types, <em>EMPLOYEE</em> and
<em>DEPARTMENT</em>, we choose the latter to play the role of <em>S</em>
because it (and not the former) is constrained to participate totally.
(Recall that every department must have a manager; not every employee must
be a manager, however.)
Following the guidelines, we add foreign key attribute <em>MgrSSN</em>
(corresponding to primary key <em>SSN</em> of <b>EMPLOYEE</b>) to relation
<b>DEPARTMENT</b>.  We also add attribute <em>MgrStartDate</em>,
corresponding to the <em>StartDate</em> attribute of <tt>MANAGES</tt>.

<p>
Updating our relational schema, we get
<ul>
  <li><b>DEPARTMENT</b>(<em><u>Name</u>, Number, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate</em>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
In the case that <em>both</em> participating entity types are constrained
to participate totally in <tt>R</tt>, a viable alternative approach is
to map the two entity types, plus the relationship, into a single
relation.  This relation would include all the atomic sub-attributes of
all attributes of <em>S</em>, <em>T</em>, and <tt>R</tt>
not involving multi-valuedness.

<H3>Step 4: 1:N and N:1 Relationships</H3>
</p><p>
For each regular (i.e., non-identifying) binary N:1 relationship type
<tt>R</tt> involving entity types <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>
(where <em>S</em> is at the <em>N-side</em>),
include as a foreign key in <b>S</b>
the attribute(s) forming the primary key of <b>T</b>.
(This makes sense, as each entity in <em>S</em>'s entity set will 
participate in at most one instance of <tt>R</tt>.)
</p><p>
Include as attributes of <b>S</b>, in addition, any atomic sub-attributes
of attributes of <tt>R</tt> not involving multi-valuedness.
</p><p>
For (regular) 1:N relationships, do the same thing, reversing the roles of
<em>S</em> and </em>T</em>.
</p><p>
In the COMPANY example, this guideline leads us to augment our
relational schema to obtain the following:
<ul>
  <li><b>EMPLOYEE</b>(<em><u>SSN</u>, Fname, Minit, Lname, Bdate,
       Sex, Address, Salary, <font color="blue"> DeptNum, 
       SuperSSN</font></em> )
  </li>
  <li><b>PROJECT</b>(<em><u>Name</u>, Number, Location,
      <font color="blue">CntrlDeptNum</font></em>)
  </li>
</ul>

<H3>Step 5: M:N Relationships</H3>
<p>
For each M:N relationship type <em>R</em>, create a new relation <b>R</b>
to represent <em>R</em>.
Include as foreign key attributes in <b>R</b> the primary keys of the
relations corresponding to the participating entity types.
Together those attributes will comprise the primary key of <b>R</b>
<p>
Include as attributes of <b>R</b>, in addition, all atomic sub-attributes
of attributes of <em>R</em> not involving multi-valuedness.
<p>
Note that, unlike 1:1, 1:N, and N:1 relationships, 
we cannot represent an M:N relationship by including a
foreign key (plus any attributes of the relationship) in a 
relation corresponding to one of the two participating entity types.
<p>
In the COMPANY example, the M:N relationship <tt>WORKS_ON</tt> is
mapped into a relation <b>WORKS_ON</b> with foreign key attributes
<em>PNO</em> (referring to the number of the participating project instance)
and <em>ESSN</em> (referring to the SSN of the participating
employee instance).  These two attributes together form the primary key
of <b>WORKS_ON</b>.  The attribute <em>Hours</em> (taken from the
<tt>WORKS_ON</tt> relationship) is included as an attribute of
<b>WORKS_ON</b>, too.

<p>
Note that the approach described here for mapping M:N relationships
from the ER to the relational model could be applied 
(as an alternative to what was described in Steps 3 and 4)
to 1:1, 1:N, and N:1 relationships.
Doing so is recommended for relationships that are expected to
have few instances (relative to the number of instances of
the relation into which a foreign key attribute would be inserted,
following the guidelines of Step 3 or 4) in order to avoid lots
of <b>null</b> values in foreign key attributes.
<p>
Following this alternative approach, the primary key of the
"relationship relation" will be the foreign key attribute(s) that
refers to the participating entity type at the <em>N-side</em>
of the relationship.  (The foreign key attribute referring to the
entity type at the <em>1-side</em> would not be part of the primary key.)
<p>
For example, suppose that we wanted to keep track of which employees
were married to one another.  Then we would have a binary 1:1 relationship
<tt>MARRIED_TO</tt> with participating entity types 
<em>EMPLOYEE</em> and <em>EMPLOYEE</em>.  Following the guidelines of
Step 3, we would include an attribute <em>Spouse</em>, say, in the
relation <b>EMPLOYEE</b>.  But if 95% of our employees are not part
of a married couple of employees, 95% of the instances of <b>EMPLOYEE</b>
will have the value <b>null</b> in the <em>Spouse</em> attribute.
In this case, it would probably make more sense to introduce, in
accord with the guidelines of Step 5, a relation <b>MARRIED_TO</b>
instead.

<H3>Step 6: Multi-valued Attributes</H3>
<p>
For each multi-valued attribute <em>A</em>, create a new relation
<b>R</b>.  It will include as attributes all the atomic sub-attributes
of <em>A</em> plus the primary key <em>K</em> of the relation corresponding
to the entity type or relationship having <em>A</em> as a 
multi-valued attribute.
The primary key of <b>R</b> is the combination of <em>A</em> and <em>K</em>.
<p>
In our COMPANY example, consider multi-valued attribute 
<em>Locations</em> of entity type <em>DEPARTMENT</em>.
We create relation <b>DEPT_LOCATIONS</b> and include as attributes
<em>DLocation</em> (corresponding to <em>Locations</em> itself)
and the foreign key <em>DNumber</em> (referring to the number of the
department).  Together these form the primary key.
<p>
Note that E&amp;N don't address the problem of nested multi-valued
sub-attributes.
