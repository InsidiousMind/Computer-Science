<h2>
CMPS340 <br />
Some More Sample Relational Algebra Queries<br />
</h2>

</p><p>
With respect to the SCHOOL database (from the web page introducing
relational algebra) devise solutions, in Relational Algebra, to the
following informally-stated queries.

</p><p>
The SCHOOL database has three relations/tables: <b>Student</b>,
<b>EnrolledIn</b>, and <b>Teaches</b>.
The key of <b>Student</b> is <b>ID</b>.  The key of each other 
table is the set of all its attributes.

</p><p>
Here is a possible snapshot of the database:

<center>
<table cellpadding="20"> 
<tr>
  <td>  <!-- Student table -->
    <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
      <tr><th colspan="4"><font size="+1"><b>Student</b></font></th></tr>
      <tr><th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Sex</th><th>Class</th></tr>
      <tr><td>2</td><td>Mary</td><td>F</td><td>2</td>
      <tr><td>6</td><td>John</td><td>M</td><td>4</td>

<b>1.</b>
List the name and class of each student who is a female and either
a junior or senior.

FROM RESTRICT Student
     WHERE Sex = 'F' AND (Class = 3 OR Class = 4)
</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
List the name of each student enrolled in <tt>MATH 2</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Name
FROM JOIN Student
     WITH (RESTRICT EnrolledIn WHERE CourseID = 'MATH 2')
     WHERE ID = StuID </pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
List the IDs of all faculty who teach a course in which a student 
named <em><b>Rumplestiltskin</b></em> is enrolled.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT FacID
FROM JOIN Teaches
     WITH (JOIN (RESTRICT Student WHERE Name = 'Rumplestiltskin')
           WITH EnrolledIn
           WHERE ID = StuID
          )
     WHERE CID = CourseID</pre>


<hr>
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
List the ID's of students enrolled in a course in which a student
named <em><b>Rumplestiltskin</b></em> is enrolled.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>
PROJECT StuID
FROM JOIN EnrolledIn AS e
     WITH (JOIN EnrolledIn
           WITH RESTRICT Student WHERE Name = 'Rumplestiltskin' 
           WHERE StuID = ID
          ) AS f
     WHERE e.CourseID = f.CourseID

                  )
             WITH EnrolledIn
             WHERE ID = StuID
     WITH EnrolledIn
     WHERE CrsID = CourseID</pre>
-->

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
List all names common to multiple (i.e., at least two) students.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT s1.Name
FROM JOIN Student AS s1 
     WITH Student AS s2
     WHERE s1.Name = s2.Name  AND  s1.ID &ne; s2.ID</pre>

</p><p>
The above solution illustrates the AS-clause, which is a
table aliasing feature.
The solution below is the same, but it uses attribute renaming
instead.

</p><p>
<pre>PROJECT Name
FROM JOIN Student
     WITH Student(ID&rarr;SID, Name&rarr;Sname, Sex&rarr;Ssex, Class&rarr;Sclass)
     WHERE Name = Sname AND ID &ne; SID
</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
List names of students not enrolled in CIL 102.
</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Name 
FROM NAT_JOIN Student
     WITH     PROJECT ID FROM Student
              MINUS
              (PROJECT ID 
               FROM RESTRICT EnrolledIn(StuId&rarr;ID) 
                    WHERE CourseID = 'CIL 102'
              )</pre>

</p><p>
The NAT_JOIN operator indicates a <b>natural join</b>, which is a
special, but very common, case of a JOIN in which the JOIN condition
is that all pairs of attributes having the same name must have equal 
values.  In the table that results, the pairs of attributes having
the same name are merged into a single attribute/column with that
name.
To illustrate, suppose that table S has attributes A, B, X, Y, and Z
and that table T has attributes C, D, X, Y, and Z.  So they have
the X, Y, and Z attributes in common.
Then <tt>NAT_JOIN S WITH T</tt> is equivalent to
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>
PROJECT A,B,C,D,X,Y,Z
FROM JOIN S AS s
     WITH T(X&rarr;X', Y&rarr;Y', Z&rarr;Z') AS t
     WHERE s.X = t.X' AND s.Y = t.Y' AND s.Z = t.Z'</tt></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>


</p><p>The next "solution" is <b>wrong</b> because its result
fails to include the name of a student who is not enrolled in 
CIL 102 if there is another student of the same name who <b>is</b>
enrolled in CIL 102!

</p><p>
<b>(c)</b> List the number of students who are currently enrolled in
at least one course, by class and sex.  (In other words, for each
combination of Sex and Class values, indicate how many students
are currently enrolled in a course.)

<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Class, Sex, COUNT(ID)
FROM PROJECT ID, Class, Sex
     FROM JOIN Student 
          WITH EnrolledIn

     WHERE ID = StuID
GROUP BY CourseID, Sex</pre>

</p><p>
<b>(g)</b> For each course, indicate the number of distinct classes
represented by students enrolled in it.  (E.g., If only juniors
and seniors are enrolled in a course, the answer is two for that course.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Bdate
FROM (RESTRICT Employee 
      WHERE Sex = 'M' AND (40000 &lt;= Salary AND Salary &lt;= 60000)
     );</pre>

<hr>

</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
Report the first and last names of any female employee 
who works on project 7 at least ten hours per week.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'F')
     WITH (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno = 7 AND Hours >= 10)
     WHERE Ssn = Essn; </pre>

</p><p>
Note that either or both of the RESTRICTs could have been done
<em>after</em> the join, as in
<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM RESTRICT (JOIN Employee WITH Works_On WHERE Ssn = Essn)
     WHERE Sex = 'F' AND Pno = 7 AND Hours >= 10; </pre>

<hr>

</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Report the first and last names of any employee whose salary is
at least $30,000 and who does <em>not</em> work on project 7.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
The following answer is <b>wrong</b>, as it results in the names of
employees who work on <em>at least one project other than project 7</em>
and who have a salary of at least $30,000.  Hence, it will incorrectly
include some employees (namely, those who work on project 7 in addition to
working on at least one other one) and incorrectly exclude others
(namely, those who work on no projects).

<pre><b>Below is WRONG!</b>
PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000)
     WITH (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno != 7)
     WHERE Ssn = Essn;
<b>Above is Wrong!</b> </pre>

<p>
Using the multi-step approach, here is one possible answer:
<pre>
// get SSN's of all employees
AllSsn &larr; PROJECT Ssn FROM Employee;

// get SSN's of employees who work on project 7 and rename the
// attribute so that it matches the attribute of AllSsn
Proj7Ssn &larr; PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno=7);

// use set difference operator to get SSN's of those who don't work on project 7
Non7Ssn &larr; AllSsn - Proj7Ssn;

// Now result is at hand!
Result &larr; 
   PROJECT Fname, Lname
   FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000) AS e
        WITH Non7Ssn AS f
        WHERE e.Ssn = f.Ssn; </pre>

<p>
Here is the corresponding "one-line" query:

<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname 
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000) AS e
     WITH ((PROJECT Ssn FROM Employee) - 
           (PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno=7))
          ) AS f
     WHERE e.Ssn = f.Ssn; </pre>

<p>
Note that in SQL the set difference operator is written as the word
<tt>EXCEPT</tt> rather than as a minus sign.

<hr>

<p>
<b>4.</b>
For each employee <tt>e</tt> and each project <tt>p</tt> on which <tt>e</tt>
works, report <tt>e</tt>'s last name, <tt>p</tt>'s name, and the number of
hours per week that <tt>e</tt> works on <tt>p</tt>.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Pname, Hours
FROM JOIN (JOIN Employee WITH Works_On WHERE Ssn = Essn)
     WITH Project 
     WHERE Pno = Pnumber; </pre>


<hr>
<b>5.</b>
For each employee <tt>e</tt> and each project <tt>p</tt> on which
<tt>e</tt> works, report <tt>e</tt>'s last name, <tt>p</tt>'s name,
and the name of the department that controls <tt>p</tt>.
(The <tt>Dnum</tt> attribute in <tt>Project</tt>
identifies each project's controlling department.)

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Pname, Dname
FROM JOIN Employee
     WITH (JOIN Works_On 
           WITH (JOIN Project WITH Department WHERE Dnum = Dnumber)
           WHERE Pno = Pname
          )
     WHERE Ssn = Essn); </pre>

<hr>
<p>
<b>6.</b>
Report the number of dependents of the employee having SSN 987654321.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE COUNT(*)
FROM (RESTRICT Dependents WHERE Essn = '987654321');</pre>

<hr>
<b>7.</b>
Report each employee's first and last names together with her/his 
number of dependents.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Fname, Lname, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Dependent WHERE Ssn = Essn)
GROUP BY Fname, Lname, Ssn; </pre>

<p>
Note that every item listed in the aggregate clause (i.e., between
the words <tt>AGGREGATE</tt> and <tt>FROM</tt>) must be either an
application of an aggregate function (e.g., <tt>SUM</tt>, <tt>COUNT</tt>)
or an attribute that is also listed in the group-by clause.

<hr>
<b>8.</b>
<b>(a)</b> 
Report, for each department (identified by its number), the number of
employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Dno; </pre>

<p>
<b>(b)</b> 
Report, for each department (identified by its name), the number of
employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dname, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Department WHERE Dno = Dnumber)
GROUP BY Dname;</pre>

<p>
Note that this solution assumes that <tt>Dname</tt> is a key of the
<tt>Department</tt> table, which it is, according to the discussion
in Chapter 3? where the <tt>COMPANY</tt> database schema was designed.

<p>
<b>(c)</b>
Report, for each department (identified by its number), the total
number of dependents of employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Dependent WHERE Ssn = Essn)
GROUP BY Dno </pre>
