<p>
<B>Exams:</B>&nbsp;
   One (tentatively) in late September, another (tentatively) 
   during early November, and a comprehensive final exam 
   during "final exam week" in December (between 6th and 10th??, inclusive).
   Exams are "open book", which is to say that you may refer to the
   textbook, class notes, graded homeworks, etc., during the exam.
   (Makeup exams will be offered only if circumstances warrant it,
   such as in the case of an emergency or sudden illness.)
   Short, unannounced quizzes may be administered during any class
   meeting.<br />
<p>
<b>Programming Assignments and Homework:</b>&nbsp;
   </p><p>
   There will be approximately ten assignments, counting both
   programming projects and "paper-and-pencil" assignments.
   Grades on the former will be based upon not only correctness and
   efficiency, but also on subjective attributes such as quality of
   documentation, readability, and modularization.
   </p><p>
   Assignment solutions must identify the student(s) submitting it
   (e.g., <tt>Chris Smith</tt>), the course and semester (in this case,
   <tt> CMPS 340, Fall 2016</tt>), and the assignment (e.g., <tt>HW #2</tt>).
   They should also include remarks that point out any known flaws.
   </p><p>
   Assignments turned in after the due date are subject to a
   penalty of seven percent per day.  Also, no credit is given
   for work turned in more than 72 hours beyond the due time.
   <!--  or after other students' work has been graded and returned
         (which, in some cases, may be in less than one week).
   -->
   </p><p>
   Students are allowed to collaborate with each other while working
   on assignments, <b>but such collaboration is to be acknowledged, in
   writing, within the submitted work</b>.
   Collaboration should not go so far that it becomes untruthful for a
   student to claim that submitted work is, for the most part, his or 
   her own (or that of his/her team, in the case of a team project).
   Under no circumstances is a student to copy the work of another or
   to allow another student to copy her/his work.

<b>Grading:</b>
   </p><p>
   Approximate weights:
   <font face="Courier New,Courier">
   <pre>
       Semester exams and quizzes: 30%
       Final exam:                 22%
       Programs/Homework :         45%
       Class Participation:         3%

   Mapping from numerical average to letter grade (approximate):
   <font face="Courier New,Courier">

        [94,100] --- A           [75, 79) --- C+
        [90, 94) --- A-          [71, 75) --- C
        [86, 90) --- B+          [68, 71) --- C-
        [82, 86) --- B           [63, 68) --- D+

<b>Intended Course Outcomes:</b>
</p><p>
Upon completion of the course, a successful student will have
<ul>
  <li>an appreciation for the differences between primary memory and 
      secondary storage as they relate to choices for organizing data
     (e.g., binary search trees vs. B-trees) and processing data 
     (e.g., internal vs. external sorting) 
  </li>
  <li>knowledge of alternative approaches for organizing a file of records 
  </li>
  <li>knowledge of and experience working with at least one data compression
      algorithm 
  </li>
  <li>knowledge of and experience working with indexing concepts, including
      tree-based and hashing-based indexing 
  </li>
  <li>knowledge of and experience working with relational database concepts,
      in particular querying using relational algebra 
  </li>
  <li>an appreciation for basic concepts of information retrieval 
  </li>
</ul>
