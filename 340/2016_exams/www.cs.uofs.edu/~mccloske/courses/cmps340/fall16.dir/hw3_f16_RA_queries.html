<h2>CMPS 340 Fall 2016<br />
HW#3: Relational Algebra Query Development<br />
Due: 1pm, Friday, September 23
</h2>

<p>
Using the COMPANY relational database from the Elmasri &amp; Navathe 
textbook,
<!-- (the schema diagram of which is in Figure 3.5
(5.5 in earlier editions) and a possible state of which
is illustrated in Figure 3.6 (5.6 in earlier editions)),
-->
devise queries, expressed in Relational Algebra
(preferably the sugary version that we've been using in class),
corresponding to the following queries expressed in English.


</p><p>
<b>1.</b> 
Report the first name and salary of each employee whose last name is
"Gorn" and who works for either Department 1 or Department 5.

</p><p>
<b>2.</b> 
Report the last name and birthdate of each female employee whose
salary is at least $60,000 and who works for a department named
"Bureaucracy".

</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
<b>(a)</b> 
Report the first and last names of each employee who 
has both male and female dependents.
<br />
<b>(b)</b>
Report the first and last names of each employee who 
has male dependents but no female dependents.

</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
Report the name of each project on which works an employee having 
last name "Rumplestiltskin".

</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
Report the first and last names of each employee who works on a project
that is controlled by a department other than the one for which the
employee works.

</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
Report, for each department, its name, the number of employees who work 
for it, and the sum of their salaries.
(The department for which an employee works is indicated by the 
<tt>Dno</tt> attribute in the <tt>Employee</tt> table.)
Try to formulate your query so that the result explicitly 
includes departments for which no employees work.
Assume that the aggregate <tt>SUM</tt> function treats NULL as
though it were zero.
<!--
  Report, for each of the two sexes ('M' and 'F'), the number of
  employees of that sex who manage some department and the average of
  their salaries.
-->

</p><p>
<b>7.</b>
Report, for each project and each of the two sexes, 
the number of the project, how many employees of that sex work
on that project, and the total number of hours that those employees
work on that project.  (The resulting table should have attributes
for project number, sex, # of employees, and total hours.)
