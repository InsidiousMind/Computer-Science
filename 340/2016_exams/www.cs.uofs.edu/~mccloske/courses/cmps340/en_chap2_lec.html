<h2>Notes on Chapter 2 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe (5th ed.) </h2>

<b>Still Under Construction</b>

<h3>2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances</h3>

<!-- NOTE: these notes are, for the most part, based upon the 4th edition.
Some changes were made in the 5th edition that haven't been incorporated
here.  Example is client/server stuff.

One fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it
provides some level of <em>data abstraction</em> by hiding details
of data storage that are irrelevant to database users.

</p><p>
A <b>data model</b> &mdash;a collection of concepts that can be used to
describe the conceptual/logical structure of a database&mdash;
provides the necessary means to achieve this abstraction.

</p><p>
By <em>structure</em> is meant the data types, relationships, and
constraints that should hold for the data.

</p><p>
Most data models also include a set of <b>basic operations</b>
for specifying retrievals/updates.

</p><p>
Object-oriented data models include the idea of objects having behavior
(i.e., applicable methods) being stored in the database (as opposed to
purely "passive" data).

</p><p>
According to C.J. Date (one of the leading database experts), a 
<b>data model</b> is an abstract, self-contained, logical definition
of the objects, operators, and so forth, that together constitute the
<em>abstract machine</em> with which users interact.
The objects allow us to model the <em>structure</em> of data;
the operators allow us to model its <em>behavior</em>.

</p><p>
In the <em>relational</em> data model, data is viewed as being organized
in two-dimensional tables comprised of tuples of attribute values.
This model has operations such as <tt>Project</tt>, <tt>Select</tt>,
and <tt>Join</tt>.

</p><p>
A data model is not to be confused with its <b>implementation</b>,
which is a physical realization on a real machine of the components
of the <em>abstract machine</em> that together constitute that model.

</p><p>
Logical vs. physical!!

</p><p>
There are other well-known data models that have been the basis for
database systems.  The best-known models pre-dating the relational
model are the <b>hierarchical</b> (in which the entity types form a
tree) and the <b>network</b> (in which the entity types and relationships
between them form a graph).
<!-- Show example using course grades.  (See Figure 2.8, p. 44) -->

</p><p>
<b>Categories of Data Models</b> (based on degree of abstractness):
<ul>
  <li><b>high-level/conceptual</b>: (e.g., ER model of Chapter 7
     (Chapter 3 in older editions of the text))
     provides a view close to the way users would perceive data;
     it uses concepts such as 
     <ul>
       <li><b>entity</b>: real-world object or concept (e.g., student,
           employee, course, department, event)
       </li>
       <li><b>attribute</b>: some property of interest describing an
           entity (e.g., height, age, color)
       </li>
       <li><b>relationship</b>: an interaction among entities 
           (e.g., a works-on relationship between an employee and a project;
           an enrolled-in relationship between a student and a course section)
       </li>
     </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>representational/implementational</b>: intermediate level of
      abstractness; example is relational data model (or the network model
      alluded to earlier).
      Also called <b>record-based</b> model.
  </li>
  <li><b>low-level/physical</b>: gives details as to how data is stored
      in computer system, such as record formats, orderings of records,
      access paths (indexes).  (See Chapters 17-18.)
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<b>2.1.2: Schemas, Instances, and Database State</b>
</p><p>
One must distinguish between the <em>description</em> of a database and the
database itself.  The former is called the <b>database schema</b>,
which is specified during design and is not expected to change often.
(See Figure 2.1, p. 32, for schema diagram for relational UNIVERSITY
database.)

</p><p>
In a typical database, frequently changes are made to data items stored
therein.
The data in the database at a particular time is called the <b>state</b>
of the database, or a <b>snapshot</b>.

</p><p>
Application requirements change occasionally, which is one of the reasons
why software maintenance is important.
On such occasions, a change to a database's schema may be called for.
An example would be to add a <tt>Date_of_Birth</tt> field/attribute to
the <tt>STUDENT</tt> table.
Making changes to a database schema is known as <b>schema evolution</b>.
Most modern DBMS's support schema evolution operations that can be 
applied while a database is operational.

<h3>2.2 DBMS Architecture and Data Independence</h3>

</p><p>
<b>2.2.1: Three-Schema Architecture</b>: (See Figure 2.2, page 34.)
  This idea was first described by the ANSI/SPARC committee in late 1970's.
  The goal is to separate (i.e., insert layers of "insulation" between)
  user applications and the physical database.
  C.J. Date points out that it is an ideal that few, if any, real-life 
  DBMS's achieve fully.

<ul>
  <li><b>internal level</b>: has an internal/physical schema that describes
     the physical storage structure of the database using a low-level 
     data model)
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>conceptual level</b>: has a conceptual schema describing the 
    (logical) structure of the whole database for a community of users.
    It hides physical storage details, concentrating upon describing
    entities, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints.
    Can be described using either high-level or implementational data model.
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>external/view level</b>:
    includes a number of external schemas (or user views), each of which
    describes part of the database that a particular category of users is
    interested in, hiding rest of database.
    Can be described using either high-level or implementational data model.
    (In practice, usually described using same model as is the conceptual
    schema.)
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Users (including application programs) submit queries that are
expressed with respect to the external level.
It is the responsibility of the DBMS to <b>transform</b> such a query
into one that is expressed with respect to the internal level (and
to transform the result, which is at the internal level, into
its equivalent at the external level).

</p><p>
Example: Select students with GPA &gt; 3.5.

</p><p>
Q: How is this accomplished?<br>
A: By virtue of <b>mappings</b> between the levels:
<ul>
  <li><b>external/conceptual</b> mapping
       (providing <b>logical</b> data independence)
  </li>
  <li><b>conceptual/internal</b> mapping
       (providing <b>physical</b> data independence)
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<b>Data independence</b> is the capacity to change the schema at
one level of the architecture without having to change the schema at
the next higher level.  We distinguish between <b>logical</b> 
and <b>physical</b> data independence according to which two
adjacent levels are involved.  The former refers to the ability to
change the conceptual schema without changing the external schema.
The latter refers to the ability to change the internal schema without
having to change the conceptual.

</p><p>
For an <b>example of physical data independence</b>, suppose that the
internal schema is modified (because we decide to add a new index, or 
change the encoding scheme used in representing some field's value, or
stipulate that some previously unordered file must be ordered by a
particular field).  Then we can change the mapping between the conceptual
and internal schemas in order to avoid changing the conceptual schema itself.

</p><p>
Not surprisingly, the process of transforming data via mappings can
be costly (performance-wise), which is probably one reason that
real-life DBMS's don't fully implement this 3-schema architecture.

<h3>2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces</h3>

A DBMS supports a variety of users and must provide appropriate languages
and interfaces for each category of users.

</p><p>
<b>DBMS Languages</b>
<ul>
  <li>DDL (Data Definition Language): used (by the DBA and/or 
      database designers) to specify the conceptual schema.  
  </li>
  <li>SDL (Storage Definition Language): used for specifying the 
      internal schema
  </li>
  <li>VDL (View Definition Language): used for specifying the external schemas
      (i.e., user views)
  </li>
  <li>DML (Data Manipulation Language): used for performing operations such
      as retrieval and update upon the populated database
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
The above description represents some kind of ideal.
In real-life, at least so far, the de facto standard DBMS language is
SQL (Standard Query Language), which has constructs to support the
functions needed by DDL, VDL, and DML languages.  (Early versions of
SQL had features in support of SDL functions, but no more.)

</p><p>
<b>2.3.1 DBMS Languages</b>
<p>
menu-based, forms-based, gui-based, natural language,
special purpose for parametric users, for DBA.

</p><p>
<b>2.3.2 DBMS Interfaces</b>
<ul>
  <li>Menu-based interfaces for web clients or browsing</li>
  <li>Forms-based interfaces </li>
  <li>GUI's</li>
  <li>Natural Language Interfaces</li>
  <li>Speech Input and Output</li>
  <li>Interfaces for parametric users</li>
  <li>Interfaces for the DBA</li>
</ul>
