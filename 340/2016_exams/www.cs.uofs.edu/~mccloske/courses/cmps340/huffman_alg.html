Huffman's Algorithm for Constructing a Codeword Table
</h2>

<p>
<b>Input:</b>  an alphabet <tt>A</tt> of "symbols"
(of which some "source text" is composed),
and a mapping <tt>f : A &rarr; N</tt> 
(<tt>N</tt> = set of all natural numbers), where,
for each <tt>a&isin;A</tt>, <tt>f(a)</tt> is the "frequency" with which 
<tt>a</tt> occurs in the source text.

</p><p>
<b>Output:</b> a mapping <tt>g : A &rarr; BS</tt>  
(<tt>BS</tt> = set of all bit strings) associating 
a (binary) codeword to each member of <tt>A</tt>.

   q := new PriorityQueue(); // of weighted binary trees, where
                             // lower weight equals higher priority
   do for each a&isin;A
      // make t a one-node tree with label a and weight f(a)
      t := new BinTreeLeaf(a, f(a));
      q.insert(t);          // insert t into q
   od

   do |A| - 1  times
      t1 := q.deleteMin();     // extract from q the two trees 
      t2 := q.deleteMin();     // having lowest weights

      // make t be the tree having t1 and t2 as its left and right subtrees
      // and the sum of their weights as its weight
      t := new BinTreeInteriorNode(t1, t2, t1.weight() + t2.weight());

      q.insert(t);             // insert t into Q
   od

   //At this point, q contains a single tree, the leaves of which are
   //precisely the |A| nodes with which we began

   t := q.deleteMin();   // let that tree be t

   // Now do a depth-first traversal of t in order to compute, for each
   // a in A, its codeword g(a).  The codeword for symbol a is the sequence 
   // of 0's and 1's formed by concatenating the labels of the edges on the
   // path from the root of t to the leaf whose label is a, where edges into
   // left children are labeled '0' and edges into right children are labeled
   // '1'.

   **  node v, under the assumption that the labels on the edges forming
   **  the path to v from the root spell out the given bit string
   **  (pathToHere).  During the search, as each leaf node is visited,
   **  we record (in g, which is a mapping from the source alphabet to
   **  the corresponding codewords, as induced by the tree) the bit string
   **  spelled out along the path to the leaf from the root.
