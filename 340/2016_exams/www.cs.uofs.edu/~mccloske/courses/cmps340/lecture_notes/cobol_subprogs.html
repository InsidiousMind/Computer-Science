<H2>COBOL Subprograms</H2>

<H3>Comparison with Paragraphs</H3>
<p>
It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with fact that,
within the <tt>PROCEDURE DIVISION</tt> of a COBOL (sub)program,
each paragraph is a unit of executable code that is "callable"
---via the <tt>PERFORM</tt> verb--- from within that (sub)program.
In effect, all the paragraphs in (the <tt>PROCEDURE DIVISION</tt> of)
a COBOL (sub)program are parameter-less "routines" having access to
the same data, namely, all those data items declared in the 
<tt>DATA DIVISION</tt> of that (sub)program.

<p>
In contrast, a COBOL subprogram is a separate compilation unit; 
that is, it belongs in a file by itself and is compiled independently
of its clients (i.e., other COBOL (sub)programs that call it).
In order to produce an executable file, the object code files produced
by the separate compilations of a main program and any subprograms 
it calls (directly or indirectly) must be <b>link</b>ed.  (You may wish
to read <A HREF="cobol_clr.html">instructions</A> on how to compile, link,
and execute COBOL programs in a VMS environment.)

<p>
Because the data declared in one compilation unit is not visible in any
other (and hence, subprograms cannot communicate with their callers through
the mechanism of shared data, as do the paragraphs within a compilation unit),
subprograms communicate with their callers through the mechanism of
argument-passing.  (What are called "parameters" in some languages are
referred to as "arguments" in others, including COBOL and FORTRAN.)

<H3>Comparision with Programs</H3>
<p>
The syntactic form of a COBOL subprogram is nearly identical to that
of a COBOL program; in particular, it has the same four divisions:
<tt>IDENTIFICATION</tt>, <tt>ENVIRONMENT</tt>, <tt>DATA</tt>, and
<tt>PROCEDURE</tt>.

<p>
In a subprogram, however, the <tt>DATA DIVISION</tt> 
includes ---in addition to the <tt>FILE</tt> and 
<tt>WORKING-STORAGE</tt> sections--- a <tt>LINKAGE</tt> section,
where the subprogram's <b>formal arguments</b> are
described (via <tt>PICTURE</tt> clauses, etc.)

<p>
Another syntactic difference is that, in a subprogram, the 
<tt>PROCEDURE DIVISION</tt> header includes a <tt>USING</tt> clause that
lists the names of the formal arguments and, in so doing, 
indicates the order in which the corresponding <b>actual arguments</b>
must be listed by the caller in making a call to the subprogram.

<p>
Finally, to terminate execution of a
subprogram (and return control to its caller), 
the statement <tt>EXIT PROGRAM</tt> is used, rather than
<tt>STOP RUN</tt>.  The latter statement will, as usual, have the effect
of terminating execution of the whole program; in other words, if it
is executed within a subprogram, control will not return to its caller.
 
<H3>Calling and Passing Arguments to a Subprogram</H3>
<p>
A statement used for calling a subprogram has the syntax
<center>
<tt>CALL &lt;subprogram-name&gt; USING &lt;argument-list&gt;</tt>
</center><br>

A subprogram's name is that which is specified in its <tt>PROGRAM-ID</tt>
paragraph.  The argument list is a sequence of data-names (or literals),
each (optionally) preceded by one of the two phrases
<tt>BY CONTENT</tt> or <tt>BY REFERENCE</tt>, which specifies the
mode under which the argument is passed.  The former is analogous to
a non-VAR parameter in Pascal, or to an <b>in</b> parameter in Ada,
or to all parameters in C and Java (which give you no choice but to
"pass by value").
The latter is analogous to a VAR parameter in Pascal or to an <b>in out</b>
parameter in Ada.  The default is <tt>BY REFERENCE</tt>.

<p>
For example, the following invokes the subprogram <tt>Junk</tt> and
passes to it four arguments, the first and last <tt>BY REFERENCE</tt>
and the middle two <tt>BY CONTENT</tt>:
<pre>
              CALL 'Junk' USING
                 BY REFERENCE Garbage
                 BY CONTENT   Refuse, 37
                 BY REFERENCE Rubbish </pre>

<p>
For another example, note that the <tt>PROGRAM-ID</tt> of 
<A HREF="../plus1_sub.cob">this subprogram</A>
is <tt>Plus-One</tt>; then note that, to call it, another
(sub)program would (most likely) use a statement of the form
<center><br>
<tt>CALL 'Plus-One' USING &lt;argument-list&gt;</tt>
</center><br>
as is illustrated by <A HREF="../plus1_sub_driver.cob">this calling program</A>.
(The need for quotes surrounding the name brings up a rather
interesting issue, which is discussed below.)

<H3>Miscellaneous Facts</H3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Local variables are static:</b>
    Variables declared inside a subprogram are <b>static</b>,
    meaning that their values persist from one invocation to the next.
    In other words, whatever value a variable has when one invocation
    of a subprogram ends, it will have that same value as execution 
    of the next invocation begins.
    In particular, <tt>VALUE</tt> clauses used in the declaration of
    data items in a subprogram have the effect of initializing those
    data items <b>only once</b>, as opposed to initializing them each
    time the subprogram is called.

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> This concept is not unique to COBOL.  FORTRAN works
    like this too.  In Algol-60, a language of great historical
    importance, you can specify in a variable's declaration that its value
    is to persist from one invocation to the next by using the keyword 
    <b>own</b>.  In C you can get this effect using 
    <!-- "internal -->
    "static"
    variables.  In Ada, variables declared inside a package (but not
    local to any of its subprograms) behave similarly. <b>End of note.</b>

    <p>
    By using a <tt>CANCEL</tt> statement, the syntax of which is
    <tt><center><br>CANCEL &lt;subprogram-name&gt;</center></tt><br>
    a calling program forces the local variables of the indicated
    subprogram to be "refreshed".  Thus, if a calling (sub)program
    requires that the data items in a subprogram be in a refreshed state
    each time it invokes that subprogram, it should precede each 
    <tt>CALL</tt> to that subprogram with a <tt>CANCEL</tt> statement.

    <p>
    Another way to ensure that all data items local to a subprogram
    are refreshed each time it is called is to insert the phrase
    <tt>IS INITIAL PROGRAM</tt> (both <tt>IS</tt> and <tt>PROGRAM</tt>
    are optional) immediately after the subprogram's
    name in its <tt>PROGRAM-ID</tt> paragraph.  For example,<br /><br>
    <tt> <center> 
         PROGRAM-ID. Stupid-Subprogram IS INITIAL PROGRAM.
    </center> </tt> 
  <p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Calling a subprogram:</b>
    To invoke a subprogram, a calling program uses the <tt>CALL</tt> verb,
    the syntax of which is as follows:
    <tt><center><br>CALL &lt;subprogram-name&gt; USING &lt;arg-list&gt;
    </center><br>
    </tt>
    Two points are of interest.  The first is that the subprogram name
    <em>is evaluated</em>!  That is, to call the subprogram Junk, you would 
    (usually) write

    <tt><center><br>CALL 'Junk' USING ....</center></tt><br>

    Notice the single quotes surrounding the subprogram name.
    If you were instead to write

    <tt><center><br>CALL Junk USING ....</center></tt><br>

    the subprogram called would be the one whose name is the current
    value of the data item <tt>Junk</tt>!!!
    For example, if <tt>Junk</tt> had been declared using the
    picture clause <tt>PIC X(7)</tt> and had the value <tt>"Destroy"</tt>
    at the time the above call were made, then the call would be to the
    subprogram <tt>Destroy</tt>!
    If, later in execution, the value of <tt>Junk</tt> had
    been modified to, say, <tt>"MrSpock"</tt>, then execution of the same
    <tt>CALL</tt> statement would result in the invocation of the 
    subprogram having that name!

    <p>
    This is an extremely powerful and dangerous feature, and one that you
    would expect to find in a language such as LISP that readily supports
    AI applications, but not in a data processing language!

    <p>
    The second interesting point is that it is the caller, rather than
    the subprogram, which determines the mode under which each argument
    is passed.  (Did you notice this during the discussion of the
    <tt>CALL</tt> verb above?)
    In Pascal and Ada, for example, the mode of each formal
    parameter is specified in the definition of the subprogram.  That
    is, the subprogram determines the mode of parameter passing for
    each parameter.  By giving control of this to the caller, it makes
    it impossible to describe a subprogram's effects in terms of a single
    pre- and post-condition pair.  Instead, (in the worst case) you'd
    need a distinct pair of conditions for each of the possible 2<sup>k</sup>
    choices of passing the arguments, where k is the # of arguments.
