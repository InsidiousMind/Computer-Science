<H2>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</H2>

<p>
The first part of a COBOL (sub)program is its <b>IDENTIFICATION DIVISION</b>.
This division contains information that helps to identify the (sub)program,
such as program name (the only required piece of info), author, date written,
etc.

<p>
It typically looks something like
<tt><pre>
      IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.
      PROGRAM-ID. Payroll-Processing.
      AUTHOR.  Joe Programmer.
      DATE-WRITTEN. June 15, 1973.
      **********************************************
      *  Program Abstract: blah blah blah
      *    
      *  Input:  blah blah
      *    
      *  Output: blah blah
      ********************************************** </pre></tt>

<p>
The only required paragraph is the one named <tt>PROGRAM-ID</tt>.
In it, the programmer supplies a data-name (in this case, 
<tt>Payroll-Processing</tt>) that identifies the program.
There are a number of other paragraphs (each having a pre-defined name) 
that may be included.  Here we have shown paragraphs named <tt>AUTHOR</tt>
and <tt>DATE-WRITTEN</tt>.

<p>
By convention, we also include several lines of comments (each of which
is signaled by an asterisk in the first position) in which is given the
Program Abstract and in which the Inputs and Outputs (and the intended
relationship between the two) of the program are described.

of <em>Comprehensive COBOL</em>.
