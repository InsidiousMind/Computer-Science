<H2>ENVIRONMENT DIVISION</H2>

<p>
The second division occurring within a COBOL (sub)program is the
ENVIRONMENT DIVISION, which supplies installation-specific information
regarding what computer equipment is needed to run the program.

<p>
Its two sections are the CONFIGURATION SECTION, which is just
about useless, and the INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION, in which is 
established the mapping from file names used in the program to 
actual files on the computer system.  Specifically, this occurs in
the FILE-CONTROL paragraph.

<p>
A typical example of what appears in this division is

<tt><pre>
      ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.
      INPUT-OUTPUT SECTION.
      FILE-CONTROL.
          SELECT Data-File ASSIGN TO "data.dat".
          SELECT Output-File ASSIGN TO SYS$OUTPUT.  </pre></tt>

<p>
Here, we have mapped the file referred to in the program by the data-name 
<tt>Output-File</tt> to standard output (which, in the VMS operating system,
is indicated by SYS$OUTPUT).  Similarly, the file referred to inside the
program as <tt>Data-File</tt> is mapped to the file with name 
<tt>data.dat</tt> on the computer system.  
It is possible to map internal files to programmer-defined logical
names (which themselves can be linked to the names of actual files via
scripts, or command files, or JCL, or whatever), thereby making the program
more flexible (e.g., by allowing it to access different files each time it
is run, without having to recompile it).

<p>
Notice that a <tt>SELECT</tt> clause may not intersect with "Area A";
that is, they must be indented to at least the fifth position on the line.
(Area A includes columns 1-4 on each line, which only certain syntactic
entities may occupy.)
