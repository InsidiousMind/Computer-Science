  <title>CMPS 340  Some Sample Sugared Relational Algebra Queries</title>

<h2>CMPS 340 Fall 2014<br />
Even More Sample Queries in SRA (Sugared Relational Algebra)
</h2>

<!-- Note: The first five sample queries here come directly from 
     Fall 2014 HW #3 in CMPS 340.  The last two (using aggregate
     operations) were made up so as to not correspond to Fall 2015's
     HW #3.  (Unfortunately, the last two problems in Fall 2014's
     and 2015's are too closely related.)

<p>
Using the COMPANY relational database from the 6th edition of the 
Elmasri/Navathe textbook (the schema diagram of which is in Figure 3.5
(5.5 in earlier editions) and a possible state of which
is illustrated in 
<a href="elmasri_navathe.dir/en_6e_fig_3-6.pdf">Figure 3.6</a> (page 72)
(or Figure 5.6 in earlier editions)), devise queries,
expressed in Syntactically-sugared Relational Algebra (SRA), 
corresponding to the following queries expressed in English.

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>1.</b> 
Report the first name, sex, and salary of each employee whose last name is
'Rumplestiltskin' and who works for either Department 1 or Department 8.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Fname, Sex, Salary
FROM RESTRICT Employee
     WHERE Lname = 'Rumplestiltskin' AND (Dno = 1 OR Dno = 8)</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>2.</b> 
Report the last name and birthdate of each female employee whose
salary is at least $50,000 and who works for a department named
either "Data Processing" or "Quality Assurance".

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Bdate
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'F' AND Salary &ge; 50000)
     WITH (RESTRICT Department 
           WHERE Dname = 'Data Processing' OR Dname = 'Quality Assurance')
     WHERE Dno = Dnumber</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>3.</b>
Report the first and last name of each male employee who 
has no dependents.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> (Three of them)
The first solution introduces a syntactic mechanism, 
</p><p><center>
<b><tt>LET &lt;name&gt; BE &lt;table-expr-1&gt; IN
&lt;table-expr-2&gt;</tt></b>
</center>

</p><p> which produces the table described by the expression
&lt;table-expr-2&gt;, in which we are allowed to use the 
specified &lt;name&gt; (any number of times) to refer to the
table described by &lt;table-expr-1&gt;.
In our solution, we use the name <tt>Male_Empl</tt> to refer to
the subset of the <tt>Employee</tt> table that includes only the
tuples describing male employees.

<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM LET Male_Empl BE (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'M')
     IN JOIN Male_Empl AS m
        WITH (PROJECT Ssn FROM Male_Empl
              MINUS
              PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM Dependent
             ) AS d
        WHERE m.Ssn = d.Ssn</pre>

</p><p>
The second solution uses a <b>natural join</b>, which is a join in which
the implicit join condition is that values of attributes with the same names
have equal values.

<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM LET Male_Empl BE (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'M')
     IN NATURAL_JOIN Male_Empl
        WITH (PROJECT Ssn FROM Male_Empl
              MINUS
              PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM Dependent
             )</pre>

</p><p>
The third solution employs a <b>left outer join</b>, which is a join 
that produces a table that includes, in addition to the usual tuples, 
a tuple for each tuple in the left operand that has no "matching" tuple
in the right operand.  These "extra" tuples have NULLs in all the attributes
that come from the right operand.

<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM LEFT_OUTER_JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'M') 
     WITH Dependent
     WHERE Ssn = Essn 
WHERE Essn IS NULL</pre>

</p><p>
On a technical (one might even say pedantic) note,
we refrain from saying <tt>Essn = NULL</tt> because of the special
nature of <tt>NULL</tt>, which does not refer to a value but rather
to the <b>absence</b> of a value.
For this reason we view it to be meaningless to ask whether 
<tt>NULL</tt> is equal to anything.

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>4.</b>
Report the names of any projects on which an employee having last name
"Rumplestiltskin" works at least 20 hours per week.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>
PROJECT Pname
FROM JOIN 
       (JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Lname = 'Rumplestiltskin')
        WITH (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Hours &ge; 20)
        WHERE Ssn = Essn
       )
     WITH Project
     WHERE Pno = Pnumber</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>5.</b>
Report the SSN of any employee who works on a project that is controlled
by a department other than the one for which the employee works.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>
PROJECT Ssn
FROM JOIN Employee
     WITH (JOIN Works_On WITH Project WHERE Pno = Pnumber)
     WHERE Ssn = Essn AND Dno &ne; Dnum</pre>

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>6.</b>
Report, for each employee having at least one dependent,
the number of dependents of each sex that that employee has.
(Identify each employee by SSN.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE e.Ssn, d.Sex, COUNT(*)
FROM JOIN Employee AS e
     WITH Dependent AS d
     WHERE e.Ssn = d.ESsn
GROUP BY e.Ssn, d.Sex</pre>

<!--
</p><p>
Note that, in the resulting table, each COUNT value will be greater
than zero.  Thus, an employee having no dependents will not be listed
at all and one having dependents of only one sex will be listed only
once.  If we want to include employees with no dependents, we could
use a left outer-join, like this:


//The query below is WRONG!!  Because d.Sex will be NULL!!

<pre>AGGREGATE e.SSN, d.Sex, COUNT(d.Dependent_Name)
FROM LEFT_OUTER JOIN Employee AS e
     WITH Dependent AS d
     WHERE e.SSN = d.ESSN
GROUP BY e.SSN, d.Sex</pre>

</p><p>
This time we counted distinct values of d.Dependent_Name so that
tuples with NULL in that field would not be counted.
(This assumes (reasonably), that tuples with NULL in the counted
field are not counted.)

</p><p>
If we wanted to ensure that every employee had two tuples describing
her/him, one listing number of male dependents and the other listing
the number of female dependents, we could do it like this:

// The query below is WRONG for the same reason as the one above.

<pre>UNION
  AGGREGATE e.SSN, d.Sex, COUNT(d.Dependent_Name)
  FROM LEFT_OUTER JOIN Employee AS e
       WITH (RESTRICT Dependent WHERE Sex = 'M') AS d
       WHERE e.SSN = d.ESSN
  GROUP BY e.SSN, d.Sex</pre>
WITH
  AGGREGATE e.SSN, d.Sex, COUNT(d.Dependent_Name)
  FROM LEFT_OUTER JOIN Employee AS e
       WITH (RESTRICT Dependent WHERE Sex = 'F') AS d
       WHERE e.SSN = d.ESSN
  GROUP BY e.SSN, d.Sex</pre>

</p><p>
Here we simply repeated the previous solution separately for male and
female dependents, and then took the union of the two resulting tables.
