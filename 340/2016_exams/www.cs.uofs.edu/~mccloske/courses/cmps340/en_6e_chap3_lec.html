<h2>Notes on Chapter 3 of Elmasri &amp; Navathe (6th edition):
   The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints
   and Relational Algebra
</h2>


<h3>Origins</h3>
</p><p>
British mathematician
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_F._Codd">E.F. (Ted) Codd</A>
of IBM first proposed the relational data model in a seminal paper in 1970 
(<em>A Relational Model for Large Shared Data Banks</em>,
Communications of the ACM, June 1970), which led to a revolution
in the field of database management.
It is based upon the mathematical concepts of <b>relations</b>,
<b>set theory</b> and <b>predicate logic</b>.
Codd, who died in 2003, went on to write extensively about the subject.
As a result of his achievements, Codd was awarded the highest honor
in computer science, the ACM Turing Award, in 1981.

</p><p>
The first commercial implementations of the relational model became
available in the early 1980's (e.g., SQL/DS by IBM and Oracle DBMS)
and, since then, the model has been implemented in a large number
of commerical systems.  Currently popular DBMS's based upon the relational
model include DB2 (IBM), Oracle, SQL Server (Microsoft), and PostgreSQL.
(How about MySQL?)

is an image of a snapshot of the COMPANY relational database that we will 
use as a case study throughout the semester.

<h3>3.1 Relational Model Concepts</h3>

<ul>
  <li><b>Domain</b>: A (usually named) set/universe of <em>atomic</em>
      values, where by "atomic" we mean simply that, from the point of
      view of the database, each value in the domain is indivisible
      (i.e., cannot be broken down into component parts).
      <p>
      Examples of domains (some taken from page 61):
      <ul>
        <li>USA_phone_number: string of digits of length ten</li>
        <li>SSN: string of digits of length nine</li>
        <li>Name: string of characters beginning with an upper case letter</li>
        <li>GPA: a real number between 0.0 and 4.0</li>
        <li>Sex: a member of the set { female, male } </li>
        <li>Dept_Code: a member of the set
            { CMPS, MATH, ENGL, PHYS, PSYC, ... } </li>
      </ul>
      </p><p>
      These are all <em>logical</em> descriptions of domains.
      For implementation purposes, it is necessary to provide descriptions
      of domains in terms of concrete <b>data types</b> (or <b>formats</b>)
      that are provided by the DBMS (such as <tt>String</tt>, <tt>int</tt>,
      <tt>boolean</tt>), in a manner analogous to how programming languages
      have intrinsic data types.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>Attribute</b>: the <em>name</em> of the role played by some value
      (coming from some domain) in the context of a <b>relational schema</b>.
      The domain of attribute <tt>A</tt> is denoted <tt>dom(A)</tt>.
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>Tuple</b>: A tuple is a mapping from attributes to
      values drawn from the respective domains of those attributes.
      A tuple is intended to describe some entity (or relationship between
      entities) in the miniworld.
      </p><p>
      As an example, a tuple for a PERSON entity might be
      </p><p>
      <center><tt>{ Name --&gt; "Rumpelstiltskin",
          &nbsp; Sex --&gt; Male,
          &nbsp; IQ --&gt; 133 }
      </tt></center>
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>Relation</b>: A (named) set of tuples all of the same form (i.e.,
      having the same set of attributes).
      The term  <b>table</b> is a loose synonym.
      (Some database purists would argue that a table is "only" a 
      physical manifestation of a relation.)
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>Relational Schema</b>: used for describing (the structure of)
      a relation.
      E.g., <tt>R(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>,
      ..., A<sub>n</sub>)</tt> says that <tt>R</tt> is a relation
      with <em>attributes</em> <tt>A<sub>1</sub></tt>, ...
      <tt>A<sub>n</sub></tt>.  The <b>degree</b> of a relation
      is the number of attributes it has, here <em>n</em>.
      </p><p>
      Example: <tt>STUDENT(Name, SSN, Address)</tt>
      </p><p>
      (See Figure 3.1, page 63, for an example of a STUDENT relation/table
      having several tuples/rows.)
      </p><p>
      <b>Note:</b> One would think that, for completeness, a relational schema
      should also specify the domain of each attribute. <b>End of note.</b>
  </li>
  </p>
  <li><b>Relational Database</b>: A collection of <b>relations</b>,
      each one consistent with its specified relational schema.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.1.2 Characteristics of Relations</h3>
<p>
<b>Ordering of Tuples</b>: A relation is a <em>set</em> of tuples;
hence, there is no order associated with them.  That is, it makes no
sense to refer to, for example, the 5th tuple in a relation.
When a relation is depicted as a table, the tuples are necessarily listed
in <em>some</em> order, of course, but you should attach no significance
to that order.
Similarly, when tuples are represented on a storage device, they must
be organized in <em>some</em> fashion, and it may be advantageous,
from a performance standpoint, to organize them in a way that depends upon
their content. 

</p><p>
<b>Ordering of Attributes</b>: A tuple is best viewed as a mapping
from its attributes (i.e., the names we give to the roles played by
the values comprising the tuple) to the corresponding values.
Hence, the order in which the attributes are listed in a table is
irrelevant.
(Note that, unfortunately, the set theoretic operations in
relational algebra (at least how E&amp;N define them) 
make implicit use of the order of the attributes.
Hence, E&amp;N view attributes as being arranged as a sequence
rather than a set.)

</p><p>
<b>Values of Attributes</b>: For a relation to be in 
<em>First Normal Form</em>, each of its attribute domains must 
consist of atomic (neither composite nor multi-valued) values.
Much of the theory underlying the relational model was based upon this
assumption.
Chapter 15 (on functional dependencies, etc.) addresses the issue of
including non-atomic values in domains.
(Note that in the latest edition of C.J. Date's book, he explicitly
argues against this idea, admitting that he has been mistaken in the past.)

</p><p>
The <b>Null</b> value: used for <em>don't know</em>, <em>not applicable</em>.

</p><p>
<b>Interpretation of a Relation</b>: Each relation can be viewed as
a <b>predicate</b> and each tuple in that relation can be viewed as
an assertion for which that predicate is satisfied 
(i.e., has value <b>true</b>) for the combination of
values in it.  In other words, each tuple represents a fact.
Example (see Figure 3.1): The first tuple listed means: 
There exists a student having name <tt>Benjamin Bayer</tt>,
having SSN <tt>305-61-2435</tt>, having age 19, etc.
</p><p>
Keep in mind that some relations represent facts about entities
(e.g., students)
whereas others represent facts about relationships (between entities).
(e.g., students and course sections).

</p><p>
The <b>closed world assumption</b> states that the only true facts
about the miniworld are those represented by whatever tuples currently
populate the database.
For example, if the tuple 
<tt>{ Name --&gt; "Spock", Sex --&gt; Male, IQ --&gt; 210 }</tt>
is not a member of the (aforementioned) PERSON relation,
then it must be that, in whatever miniworld is being modeled by the
database of which this relation is a part, there is no person 
satisfying all three conditions of being named "Spock", being male, and
having an IQ of 210.

</p><p>
<b>3.1.3 Relational Model Notation</b>: (pages 66-67)
<p>
<ul>
  <li><em>R(A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub>)</em>
      is a relational schema of degree <em>n</em> denoting that
      there is a relation <em>R</em> having as its attributes 
      <em>A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub></em>.
  </li>
  <li>By convention, <em>Q</em>, <em>R</em>, and <em>S</em>
      denote relation names.
  </li>
  <li>By convention, <em>q</em>, <em>r</em>, and <em>s</em>
      denote relation states.  For example, <em>r(R)</em> 
      denotes one possible state of relation <em>R</em>.
      If <em>R</em> is understood from context, this could be
      written, more simply, as <em>r</em>.
  </li>
  <li>By convention, <em>t</em>, <em>u</em>, and <em>v</em>
      denote tuples.
  </li>
  <li>The "dot notation" <em>R.A</em> (e.g., <tt>STUDENT.Name</tt>)
      is used to qualify an attribute name, usually for the purpose
      of distinguishing it from a same-named attribute in a different
      relation (e.g., <tt>DEPARTMENT.Name</tt>).
  </li>
  <li>If <em>t</em> is a tuple in a relation with attributes
      <em>A<sub>1</sub></em> through <em>A<sub>n</sub></em>,
      <em>t[A<sub>i</sub>]</em> (or <em>t.A<sub>i</sub></em>) refers
      to the value of attribute <em>A<sub>i</sub></em> in <em>t</em>.
  </li>
  <li>To describe such a tuple <em>t</em> in its entirety, we could say
      <em>t = &lt;v<sub>1</sub>,v<sub>2</sub>,...,v<sub>n</sub>&gt;</em>,
      meaning that, for each <em>i</em>,
      <em>t[A<sub>i</sub>] = v<sub>i</sub></em>. 
      For example, we might say <em>t</em> = &lt;"Rumplestiltskin",
      135, "black"&gt; to describe a tuple from a relation with
      attributes <em>Name</em>, <em>Age</em>, and <em>FavoriteColor</em>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas</h3>
<p>
Constraints on databases can be categorized as follows:
<ul>
  <li><b>inherent model-based</b> (or <b>implicit</b>): constraints
      that are inherent in the definition/assumptions of a particular
      data model hold in <em>every</em> database having that 
      data model as its underpinning.
      <b>Example:</b> In the relational model, no two tuples in a relation
      can be duplicates.
      <b>Why?</b> Because a relation is a <em>set</em> of tuples, as
      opposed to a bag/multiset or a sequence. 
  </li> 
  <li><b>schema-based:</b> can be expressed using DDL (data definition
      language); this kind is the focus of this section.
  </li>
  <li><b>application-based:</b> are specific to the "business rules"
      of the miniworld and are typically difficult or impossible to express
      and enforce within the data model.  Hence, it is left to application
      programs to enforce.  <b>Example:</b> No employee may have a salary
      greater than that of her supervisor.
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
Elaborating upon <b>schema-based constraints</b>:

</p><p>
<b>3.2.1 Domain Constraints</b>:
Each attribute value must be either <b>null</b> (which is really a
<em>non-value</em>) or drawn from the domain of that attribute.
Note that some DBMS's allow you to impose the <b>not null</b>
constraint upon an attribute, which is to say that no tuple
(in the relevant relation) is allowed to have the (non-)value 
<b>null</b> in that attribute.

</p><p>
<b>3.2.2 Key Constraints</b>: A relation is a <em>set</em> of tuples,
and each tuple's "identity" is given by the values of its attributes.
Hence, it makes no sense for two tuples in a relation to be identical
(because then the two tuples are actually one and the same tuple).
That is, no two tuples may have the same combination of values in their
attributes.
</p><p>
Usually the miniworld dictates that there be (proper) subsets of attributes
for which no two tuples may have the same combination of values.
Such a set of attributes is called a <b>superkey</b> of its relation.
From the fact that no two tuples can be identical, it follows that the
set of all attributes of a relation constitutes a superkey of that relation.
</p><p>
A <b>key</b> is a <em>minimal superkey</em>, i.e., a superkey such
that, if we were to remove any of its attributes, the resulting set
of attributes would fail to be a superkey.
</p><p>
<b>Example</b>: Suppose that we stipulate that a faculty member is
uniquely identified by <em>Name</em> and <em>Address</em> and also
by <em>Name</em> and <em>Department</em>, but by no single one of the three
attributes mentioned.  Then <em>{ Name, Address, Department }</em> is a
(non-minimal) superkey and each of <em>{ Name, Address }</em> and
<em>{ Name, Department }</em> is a key (i.e., minimal superkey).

<p><b>Candidate key</b>: any key!  (Hence, it is not clear what
distinguishes a key from a candidate key.)

<p><b>Primary key</b>: a key chosen to act as the means by which
to identify tuples in a relation.  Typically, one prefers a primary
key to be one having as few attributes as possible.

<h3>3.2.3 Relational Databases and Relational Database Schemas</h3>
<p>
A <b>relational database schema</b> is a set of schemas for its relations
(see Figure 3.5, page 71) together with a set of 
<b>integrity constraints</b>.
</p><p>
A <b>relational database state/instance/snapshot</b> is a set of states
of its relations such that no integrity constraint is violated.
(See Figure 3.6, page 72, for a snapshot of COMPANY.)

<h3>3.2.4 Entity Integrity, Referential Integrity, and Foreign Keys</h3>
<p>
<b>Entity Integrity Constraint</b>: In a tuple, none of the values of 
the attributes forming the relation's primary key may have the (non-)value
<b>null</b>.  Or is it that at least one such attribute must have a
non-null value?  In my opinion, E&amp;N do not make it clear!

</p><p>
<b>Referential Integrity Constraint</b>: (See Figure 3.7, page 75.)
A <b>foreign key</b> of relation <em>R</em> is a set of its attributes 
intended to be used (by each tuple in <em>R</em>) for identifying/referring to
a tuple in some relation <em>S</em>.
(<em>R</em> is called the <em>referencing</em> relation and
<em>S</em> the <em>referenced</em> relation.)
For this to make sense, the set of attributes of <em>R</em>
forming the foreign key should "correspond to" some superkey of <em>S</em>.
Indeed, by definition we require this superkey to be the primary key of
<em>S</em>.

</p><p>
This constraint says that, for every tuple in <em>R</em>, the tuple in
<em>S</em> to which it refers must actually be in <em>S</em>.
<!-- and fact that a tuple referenced (via
   foreign key) by another <em>must exist</em>.
-->
Note that a foreign key may refer to a tuple in the same relation
and that a foreign key may be part of a primary key (indeed, for
weak entity types, this will always occur).
A foreign key may have value <b>null</b> (necessarily in all its
attributes??), in which case it does not refer to any tuple in the
referenced relation.

</p><p>
<b>Semantic Integrity Constraints</b>: application-specific restrictions
that are unlikely to be expressible in DDL.  Examples:
<ul>
  <li>salary of a supervisee cannot be greater than that of her/his
      supervisor
  </li>
  <li>salary of an employee cannot be lowered</li>
  <li>a department manager cannot be less than 35 years old</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.3 Update Operations and Dealing with Constraint Violations</h3>
<p>
For each of the <em>update</em> operations (Insert, Delete, and Update),
we consider what kinds of constraint violations may result from applying
it and how we might choose to react.

</p><p>
<b>3.3.1 Insert</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>domain constraint violation: some attribute value is not of
           correct domain
  </li>
  <li>entity integrity violation: some attribute within a key of 
      the new tuple has "value" <b>null</b>
  </li>
  <li>key constraint violation: key of new tuple is same as key of
      already-existing tuple
  </li>
  <li>referential integrity violation: foreign key of new tuple refers
       to non-existent tuple
  </li>
</ul>
Ways of dealing with it: reject the attempt to insert!
<!--  Or give user opportunity to try again with different attribute values.-->

</p><p>
<b>3.3.2 Delete</b>: 
<ul>
  <li>referential integrity violation: a tuple referring to the deleted
       one exists.
  </li>
</ul>
Three options for dealing with it:
<ul>
  <li>Reject the deletion</li>
  <li>Attempt to <b>cascade</b> (or <b>propagate</b>) by deleting
      any referencing tuples (plus those that reference them, etc., etc.)
  </li>
  <li>modify the foreign key attribute values in referencing tuples to
      <b>null</b> or to some valid value referencing a different tuple
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<b>3.3.3 Update</b>:
<ul>
  <li>Key constraint violation: primary key is changed so as to become
        same as another tuple's
  </li>
  <li>referential integrity violation:
      <ul>
        <li>foreign key is changed and new one refers to nonexistent tuple
        </li>
        <li>primary key is changed and now other tuples that had referred
            to this one violate the constraint
        </li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p><p>
<b>3.3.4 Transactions</b>:
This concept is relevant in the context where multiple users and/or
application programs are accessing and updating the database concurrently.
A transaction is a logical unit of work that may involve several accesses
and/or updates to the database (such as what might be required to reserve
several seats on an airplane flight).  The point is that, even though
several transactions might be processed concurrently, the end result
must be as though the transactions were carried out sequentially.
(Example of simultaneous withdrawals from same checking account.)
