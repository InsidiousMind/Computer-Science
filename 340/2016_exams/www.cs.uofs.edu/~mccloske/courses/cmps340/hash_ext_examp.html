Extendible Hashing insertion/deletion examples
</H3>

<p>
Suppose that we are using an extendible hash table with bucket size 2 and
suppose that our hash function H is such that

<pre>
   H(ANT)  = 1110...       H(DOG)   = 0101...       H(PIG)  = 1001...
   H(BEAR) = 0010...       H(ELK)   = 1000...       H(RAT)  = 0000...
   H(CAT)  = 1010...       H(GORN)  = 1010...       H(WOLF) = 0111...
   H(COW)  = 0001...       H(MOOSE) = 0001...  </pre>

<p>
At the present time, the hash table is as follows:

<pre>

<p>
Each bucket has an associated <em>label</em> (or <em>signature</em>)
indicating which cells in the directory point to it:  namely, all those
having an index whose binary representation has the label as a prefix.

<p>
For each of the following operations, apply it to the hash table above
(not to the result of applying the previous operations) and show the
hash table that results.
<pre>
      (a)  Insert WOLF.              (b)  Insert ANT.
      (c)  Insert GORN.              (d)  Delete DOG. 
      (e)  Delete RAT.               (f)  Delete CAT.
      (g)  Insert MOOSE.
</pre>

<p>
<b>SOLUTIONS:</b>

<p>
<b>(a)</b> Insert WOLF.
  WOLF fits quite nicely alongside DOG in the bucket with
      label <tt>01</tt>.  (Illustration omitted.)

<hr>
<p>
<b>(b)</b> Insert ANT.
This causes overflow of the bucket with label <tt>1</tt>, and
thus that bucket is split into buckets with labels <tt>10</tt>
and <tt>11</tt>, into which CAT and ELK are placed appropriately,
after which we attempt to insert ANT again.  Because <tt>10</tt>
is a prefix of both H(CAT) and H(ELK), both of these animals are
placed into the bucket with label <tt>10</tt>, leaving the
<tt>11</tt> bucket empty.
Insertion of ANT now goes smoothly, as it belongs in the <tt>11</tt> bucket.

<hr>
<p>
<b>(c)</b> Insert GORN.
This causes overflow of the bucket with label <tt>1</tt>, and
thus that bucket is split into buckets with labels <tt>10</tt>
and <tt>11</tt>, into which CAT and ELK are placed appropriately,
after which we attempt to insert GORN again.  Because <tt>10</tt> 
is a prefix of both H(CAT) and H(ELK), both of these animals are placed 
into the bucket with label <tt>10</tt>, leaving the <tt>11</tt>
bucket empty.  Attempting to insert GORN leads to splitting the 
<tt>10</tt> bucket into buckets with label <tt>100</tt> and 
<tt>101</tt>.  ELK is placed into the former and CAT into the latter.
Attempting to insert GORN once again, we find room for him
in the <tt>101</tt> bucket.

<p>
<b>(d)</b> Delete DOG.
Remove DOG from the <tt>01</tt> bucket.  As there are no
<em>sibling</em> buckets with which to combine it, we simply leave
the <tt>01</tt> bucket empty.
(Only a bucket with label <tt>00</tt> could be a "sibling" to the
bucket with label <tt>01</tt>, and there is no such bucket.)
(Illustration omitted.)

<hr>
<p>
<b>(e)</b> Delete RAT.
Remove RAT from the <tt>000</tt> bucket.  As the <tt>000</tt> and <tt>001</tt>
buckets are "siblings" and the total # of entries in the two of them is now
two, we can merge them into a <tt>00</tt> bucket containing COW and BEAR.
Because now the maximum length of any bucket's label is two, we can halve the
size of the directory, making its depth two.  (In real life, we probably
wouldn't merge two buckets unless the resulting bucket were somewhat less
than full, because otherwise the resulting bucket would be likely to undergo
a split in the near future.)

       +----+                  +-----+-----+
</pre>

<hr>
<p>
<b>(f)</b> Delete CAT.
Remove CAT from the <tt>1</tt> bucket.  There is no sibling bucket,
so that is all we can do.  (Illustration omitted.)

<hr>
<p>
<b>(g)</b> Insert MOOSE.
This causes overflow of the bucket with label <tt>000</tt>.
Because this bucket has depth 3, which corresponds to DIR_DEPTH, we
double the size of the directory, making each entry in the new directory
point to the correct bucket.  Then we split the overflowing bucket into
buckets with labels <tt>0000</tt> and <tt>0001</tt>, into which COW
and BEAR are placed appropriately.
Then we attempt once more to insert MOOSE.
This time, MOOSE fits nicely alongside COW in the <tt>0001</tt> bucket.
