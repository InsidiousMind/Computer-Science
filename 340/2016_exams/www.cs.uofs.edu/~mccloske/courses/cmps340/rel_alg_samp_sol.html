<h2>
CMPS340 <br />
Some Sample Relational Algebra Queries<br />
</h2>

<p>
Using the COMPANY database from the Elmasri/Navathe textbook (7th edition)
(the schema diagram of which is in Figure 5.5 and a possible state of which
is illustrated in Figure 5.6), devise solutions, in Relational Algebra,
to the following informally-stated queries.

<p>
<b>1.</b>
Report the last name and birthdate of each male employee whose salary
is between $40,000 and $60,000.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Bdate
FROM (RESTRICT Employee 
      WHERE Sex = 'M' AND (40000 &lt;= Salary AND Salary &lt;= 60000)
     );</pre>

<hr>

</p><p>
<b>2.</b>
Report the first and last names of each female employee
who works on project 7 at least ten hours per week.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Sex = 'F')
     WITH (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno = 7 AND Hours >= 10)
     WHERE Ssn = Essn; </pre>
<p>
Note that either or both of the RESTRICTs could have been done
<em>after</em> the join, as in
<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM RESTRICT (JOIN Employee WITH Works_On WHERE Ssn = Essn)
     WHERE Sex = 'F' AND Pno = 7 AND Hours >= 10; </pre>

</p><p>
Due to the fact that, in the second solution, the JOIN operation is 
being applied to tables that include tuples that cannot possibly
be relevant to the solution (e.g., ones describing male employees
and ones describing work on projects not numbered 7), it is considered
to be inferior to the first solution.  As a general rule, you
want to remove all irrelevant tuples from a table (by applying
RESTRICT to it) <b>before</b> applying JOIN rather than afterwards.

<hr>

<p>
<b>3.</b>
Report the first and last names of each employee whose salary is
at least $30,000 and who does <em>not</em> work on project 7.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
The following answer is <b>wrong</b>, as it results in the names of
employees who work on <em>at least one project other than project 7</em>
and who have a salary of at least $30,000.  Hence, it will incorrectly
include some employees (namely, those who work on project 7 in addition to
working on at least one other one) and incorrectly exclude others
(namely, those who work on no projects).

<pre><b>Below is WRONG!</b>
PROJECT Fname, Lname
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000)
     WITH (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno != 7)
     WHERE Ssn = Essn;
<b>Above is Wrong!</b> </pre>

<p>
Using the multi-step approach, here is one possible correct answer:
<pre>
// get SSN's of all employees
AllSsn &larr; PROJECT Ssn FROM Employee;

// get SSN's of employees who work on project 7 and rename the
// attribute so that it matches the attribute of AllSsn
Proj7Ssn &larr; PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno=7);

// use set difference operator to get SSN's of those who don't work on project 7
Non7Ssn &larr; AllSsn - Proj7Ssn;

// Now result is at hand!
Result &larr; 
   PROJECT Fname, Lname
   FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000) AS e
        WITH Non7Ssn AS f
        WHERE e.Ssn = f.Ssn; </pre>

</p><p>
Here is the corresponding "one-line" query:

<pre>PROJECT Fname, Lname 
FROM JOIN (RESTRICT Employee WHERE Salary >= 30000) AS e
     WITH ((PROJECT Ssn FROM Employee) - 
           (PROJECT Essn AS Ssn FROM (RESTRICT Works_On WHERE Pno=7))
          ) AS f
     WHERE e.Ssn = f.Ssn; </pre>

</p><p>
Note that in SQL the set difference operator is written as the word
<tt>EXCEPT</tt> rather than as a minus sign.

<hr>

<p>
<b>4.</b>
For each employee <tt>e</tt> and each project <tt>p</tt> on which <tt>e</tt>
works, report <tt>e</tt>'s last name, <tt>p</tt>'s name, and the number of
hours per week that <tt>e</tt> works on <tt>p</tt>.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Pname, Hours
FROM JOIN (JOIN Employee WITH Works_On WHERE Ssn = Essn)
     WITH Project 
     WHERE Pno = Pnumber; </pre>

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>5.</b>
For each employee <tt>e</tt> and each project <tt>p</tt> on which
<tt>e</tt> works, report <tt>e</tt>'s last name, <tt>p</tt>'s name,
and the name of the department that controls <tt>p</tt>.
(The <tt>Dnum</tt> attribute in <tt>Project</tt>
identifies each project's controlling department.)

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Pname, Dname
FROM JOIN Employee
     WITH (JOIN Works_On 
           WITH (JOIN Project WITH Department WHERE Dnum = Dnumber)
           WHERE Pno = Pname
          )
     WHERE Ssn = Essn);</pre>

</p><p>
<b>Alternative Solution:</b>
<pre>PROJECT Lname, Pname, Dname
FROM JOIN (JOIN Employee WITH Works_On WHERE Ssn = Essn)
     WITH (JOIN Project WITH Department WHERE Dnum = Dnumber)
     WHERE Pno = Pname;</pre>

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>6.</b>
Report the number of employees and their average salary.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE COUNT(*), AVG(Salary)
FROM Employee;</pre>


</p><p>
<hr>
<b>7.</b>
Report the number of dependents of the employee having SSN 987654321.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE COUNT(*)
FROM (RESTRICT Dependents WHERE Essn = '987654321');</pre>

<hr>
<b>8.</b>
Report each employee's first and last names together with her/his 
number of dependents.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Fname, Lname, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Dependent WHERE Ssn = Essn)
GROUP BY Fname, Lname, Ssn; </pre>

</p><p>
Note that every item listed in the aggregate clause (i.e., between
the words <tt>AGGREGATE</tt> and <tt>FROM</tt>) must be either an
application of an aggregate function (e.g., <tt>SUM</tt>, <tt>COUNT</tt>)
or an attribute that is also listed in the group-by clause.

</p><p>
<hr>
<b>10.</b>
<b>(a)</b> 
Report, for each department (identified by its number), the number of
employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Dno; </pre>

<p>
<b>(b)</b> 
Report, for each department (identified by its name), the number of
employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dname, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Department WHERE Dno = Dnumber)
GROUP BY Dname;</pre>

<p>
Note that this solution assumes that <tt>Dname</tt> is a key of the
<tt>Department</tt> table, which it is, according to the discussion
in Chapter 3? where the <tt>COMPANY</tt> database schema was designed.

<p>
<b>(c)</b>
Report, for each department (identified by its number), the total
number of dependents of employees who work for it.

<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<pre>AGGREGATE Dno, COUNT(*)
FROM (JOIN Employee WITH Dependent WHERE Ssn = Essn)
GROUP BY Dno </pre>

</p><p>
<b>11.</b>
The solutions in Problem 10 have a weakness.
Suppose that, in 10(a) or (b), there is a department for which
the number of employees who work for it is zero.  (In the
COMPANY database, every department must have at least one employee,
but we one can imagine relaxing this restriction.)
In (c), it is possible that some department has no employees
having a dependent.

</p><p>
In these cases, the number (or name) of such a department will not appear
in any tuple of the result.  But suppose that we want <b>every</b>
department to appear in the result, even if the associated number
is zero?  Is it possible to achieve this? 

</p><p>
<b>Yes</b>, we can do it using a modified version of the JOIN
operator called an <b>outer join</b>.  (The plain join operation
is an <b>inner</b> join.)  There's left, right, and full outer join.
