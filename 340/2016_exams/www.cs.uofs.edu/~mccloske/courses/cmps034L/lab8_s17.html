You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students is present.

</p><p>
Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button,
then on the link labeled <b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>,
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP4 Chapter 6</b>.

</p><p>
<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks and Exercises from Chapter 6</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.1 (readAFile)</b>:
     Multiple choice question: "How can we read data from a file in Java?".  
     </p><p>
     <b>Hint:</b> Consider what was covered in Wednesday's/Thursday's lecture
     this week and review the <tt>EmployeesGrossPay</tt> Java program
     relevant to Chapter 6 (to which there is a link on the course web page).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.2 (scannerDeclaration)</b>:
    Given is a Java statement that declares and initializes a variable of type
    <tt>Scanner</tt>.  Contrary to what is suggested, the statement is
    syntactically correct.  What's wrong with it is that it does not have
    the desired effect, which is to establish the file named <tt>test.dat</tt>
    as the input source for the newly created <tt>Scanner</tt> object.
    </p><p>
    <b>Hint:</b> Same as in previous item.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.3 (scannerDeclarationSyntax)</b>:
    Same hint as above.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.4 (scannerInputTxt)</b>:
    Same hint as above.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.5 (scannerTokens)</b>:
     Given is a line of text; multiple choice question is to identify
     the tokens that a <tt>Scanner</tt> would "find" if its <tt>next()</tt>
     method were repeatedly applied.
     </p><p>
     Remember that what separates tokens from each other are "whitespace"
     characters (spaces, tabs, and newlines).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 6.6 (scannerTokens2)</b>:
     Similar to previous item, but this time multiple lines of input
     are to be considered.  Recall that a <tt>Scanner</tt>'s <tt>next()</tt>
     method treats newline characters the same as spaces.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #2: In which you submit work!</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 6.1 (boyGirl)</b>:
     After producing a solution and verifying that it is correct (via Practice-It's
     feedback mechanism), load the Java application 
     <a href="BJP4_6_1.java">BJP4_6_1</a> into a jGrasp window and then
     copy and paste your <tt>boyGirl()</tt> method (apologies for the stupid name
     and problem premise) into the appropriate place within that application.
     Compile and execute <tt>BJP4_6_1</tt> to make sure that you've pasted the
     method into it correctly before using this
     <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab8_dir">Submit/Review</a> 
     link to submit it.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #3: Practice-It Self-Checks from Chapter 8</h3>

In Practice-It, maneuver your way to the Self-Checks associated to Chapter 8.
Don't spend a lot of time on the self-checks in this activity.  

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.1 (whatisOOP)</b>: Multiple choice</li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.2 (whatisAnObject)</b>: Multiple choice</li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.3 (StringObject)</b>: Multiple choice</li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.6 (whatIsAField)</b>: Multiple choice;
     note that <em>field</em> and <em>instance variable</em> are synonyms.
  </li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.8 (accessorMutator)</b>: Multiple choice;
     note that <em>accessor</em> and <em>observer</em> are synonyms.
  </li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.9 (methodCallSyntax)</b>: Multiple choice.</li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.13 (printingObjects)</b>: Multiple choice.</li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 8.17 (whatIsAConstructor)</b>: Multiple choice</li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #4: In which you submit work!</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="TossableCoin2.java">TossableCoin2</a> and
      <a href="TossableCoin2App.java">TossableCoin2App</a> classes
      and load them into jGrasp (or whatever IDE you are using).
      </p><p>
      Modify <tt>TossableCoin2App</tt> (and change its name to
      <tt>TossableCoin2LApp</tt>) so that, rather than tossing a coin ten
      times, it tosses the coin until either ten tosses have resulted in Heads
      or ten tosses have resulted in Tails.
      Note that objects that are instances of the <tt>TossableCoin2</tt>
      class have observer methods (namely, <tt>headsCount()</tt> and
      <tt>tailsCount()</tt>) by which a client can determine how many
      times each of Heads and Tails has resulted from past coin tosses.
      <b>Therefore, don't insert code in the client program for maintaining
      heads- and tails-counts!</b>  Rather, use the methods just mentioned 
      to obtain those counts.
      </p><p>
      Use this 
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab8_dir">Submit/Review</a> 
      link to submit the <tt>TossableCoin2LApp</tt> class.
      (Do <b>not</b> submit <tt>TossableCoin2</tt> at this time.)
  </li>
  <li>Now modify the <tt>TossableCoin2</tt> class by replacing instance variable
      <tt>showingHeads</tt> by a new instance variable, <tt>faceShowing</tt>, of
      type <tt>char</tt>.  The idea is that <tt>faceShowing</tt>'s value should
      be either <tt>'H'</tt> or <tt>'T'</tt>, respectively, depending upon whether
      the coin is showing <b>Heads</b> or <b>Tails</b>.
      </p><p>
      Make whatever modifications are necessary to the source code in
      <tt>TossableCoin2</tt> in order to make this work.  
      (Obviously, any code in the class that refers to <tt>headsShowing</tt> 
      must be changed, since that instance variable no longer plays any role
      in the class.)
      </p><p>
      If your modifications are correct, you should be able to compile the modified
      class without errors being reported, and you should be able to run both the
      <tt>TossableCoin2App</tt> and <tt>TossableCoin2LApp</tt> applications
      (without making any changes to them!), and they should exhibit similar 
      behavior to what they did before.
      </p><p>
      Use this 
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab8_dir">Submit/Review</a> 
      link to submit the modified <tt>TossableCoin2</tt> class.
