Lab #11: ReCURsion 
</h2>

</p><p>
You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students is present.

</p><p>
Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button,
then on the link labeled <b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>,
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP4 Chapter 12</b>.

<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks from Chapter 12</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 12.3 (mystery1)</b>:
     You are given a recursive method and asked to show, for several different
     parameter values, what output the method would produce.  Notice that
     the method is very similar to the <tt>printUpTo()</tt> method discussed
     in lecture.  The main difference is that the parameter passed in the
     recursive call is <tt>n/2</tt> rather than <tt>n-1</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 12.4 (mystery2)</b>:
     Similar to Self-Check 12.3, but this recursive method is unusual in that the
     base case applies when the parameter's value exceeds some upper bound
     (here 100) rather than when it reaches some lower bound (typically
     either zero or one).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 12.5 (mystery3)</b>:
     Similar to Self-Check 12.3 again, but this method sandwiches
     a recursive call in between printing a left parenthesis (or bracket)
     and printing a right parenthesis (or bracket).  (Which pair of symbols
     is printed depends upon whether or not the parameter is even.)
     </p><p>
     Thus, the output is going to be a well-formed nested bunch of 
     alternating parentheses/brackets.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 12.13 (mystery4)</b>:
     Similar to Self-Check 12.3 again, but this recursive method has
     two parameters.  Only the first one "changes" from call to call.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #2: Practice-It Exercises from Chapter 12</h3>
</p><p>
Place each method that you develop for the exercises here into
Java class <a href="Lab11.java">Lab11</a> and, at the end, 
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab11_dir">submit</a> it.

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 12.1 (starString)</b>:
     You are to develop a recursive method <tt>starString()</tt>
     so that the call <tt>starString(n)</tt> returns a <tt>String</tt>
     containing 2<sup>n</sup> asterisks.  Keep in mind that 2<sup>n-1</sup>
     is half of 2<sup>n</sup>.
     </p><p>
     Unfortunately, the Practice-It site requires that the method
     throw an exception if the parameter passed to it is negative.
     Here is a template for you to complete in order to arrive at a
     correct solution:
     </p><p>
     <center>
     <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
     <tr><td><pre>
public static String starString(int n)
{
   // Check for negative parameter and throw an exception in that case.
   if (n < 0) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(); }

   // Parameter is legal, so use normal pattern for a recursive functional method
   if (n == 0) {    // the base case
      return ??;
   }
   else {  // the recursive case
      String half = ??;        // form a String with half the required *'s
      return ??;
   }
}</pre>
     </td></tr>
     </table>
     </center>
  </li>    
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 12.2 (writeNums)</b>:
     Develop recursive method <tt>writeNums()</tt> that accepts integer
     n via its parameter and prints the integers 1 through n, all but the
     first preceded by a comma and space.  Thus, it is almost the same
     as the <tt>printUpTo()</tt> method developed in lecture, with the
     only significant difference being the insertion of commas.
     </p><p>
     Here is an almost correct solution, but it fails to print any
     commas or spaces.  Fix it.
     </p><p>
     <center>
     <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
     <tr><td><pre>
public static void writeNums(int n)
{
   // Check for non-positive parameter and throw an exception in that case.
   if (n < 1) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(); }

   // Parameter is legal, so use normal pattern for a recursive functional method
   if (n == 1) {    // the base case
      System.out.print(n);
   }
   else {  // the recursive case
      writeNums(n-1);
      System.out.print(n);
   }
}</pre>
     </td></tr>
     </table>
     </center>
  </li>
  </p><p> 
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 12.3 (writeSequence)</b>:
     Develop recursive method <tt>writeSequence()</tt> that accepts integer
     n via its parameter and prints &lceil;n/2&rceil; down to 1 and 1 back
     up to &lceil;n/2&rceil; (separated by spaces, but no commas this time),
     with 1 appearing twice only if n is even. 
     Use the template from the previous exercise to get you started.
     </p><p>
     The Practice-It instructions indicate that zero is an illegal
     parameter value.  That is unfortunate, because as a result you
     need both <tt>n==1</tt> and <tt>n==2</tt> to be base cases.
     A better design would have had <tt>n==0</tt> be a base case 
     that resulted in nothing being printed.
     If you do it that way, it will be fine, but the Practice-It site
     will probably reject your solution.
     </p><p>
     Look at the table of examples on the Practice-It web page.
     Notice that (except for the base cases of <tt>n==1</tt> and 
     <tt>n==2</tt>), what gets printed as a result of the call
     <tt>writeSequence(n)</tt> is just what <tt>writeSequence(n-2)</tt> 
     prints, sandwiched in between occurrences of &lceil;n/2&rceil;.
     </p><p>

<h3>Activity #3: Homegrown Recursive Programming Problems</h3>
</p><p>
As with your solutions to the exercises in Activity #2,
place the methods that you develop here into the <tt>Lab11</tt>
class and, when you're finished, 
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab11_dir">submit</a> it.

<ol>
  <li>
    Develop a recursive method <tt>digitSum(int n)</tt> that, given a 
    nonnegative integer via its parameter, returns the sum of the
    digits in the (decimal) numeral representing that number.  Thus, for 
    example, the call <tt>digitSum(6305)</tt> should yield 14, because that
    is the sum of 6, 3, 0, and 5.
    </p><p>
    What is the base case?  It could be <tt>n &lt; 10</tt>
    (meaning that <tt>n</tt> is represented by a one-digit numeral. 
    Or it could be <tt>n==0</tt> (meaning, conceptually, that <tt>n</tt>
    is represented by a zero-digit numeral?).  Either one will work.
    </p><p>
    As for the recursive case, note that the sum of the digits in
    <tt>6305</tt> (to use that example again) is the sum of the digits in 
    <tt>630</tt>, plus the one's digit, <tt>5</tt>.
    So the key to solving (this instance of) the problem lies in obtaining
    <tt>630</tt> and <tt>5</tt> from <tt>6305</tt>.  But these are just the
    quotient and remainder resulting from dividing <tt>6305</tt> by ten!
    The same approach works for any integer. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Here is a recursive definition of the multiplication function on 
    nonnegative integers:
    </p><p>
    <center>
    <table border="0" cellpadding="4">
    <tr>
      <td rowspan="3">productOf(m,n) =</td>
      <td>{ 0</td><td>if n = 0</td>
   </tr>
   <tr><td>{ productOf(2m, n/2)</td><td>if n&gt;0 and n is even</td>
   </tr>
   <tr><td>{ productOf(2m, (n-1)/2) + m</td><td>if n&gt;0 and n is odd</td>
   </tr>
   </table>
   </center>
   </p><p>
   Use this as the basis for completing the following recursive
   Java method, which has two recursive cases rather than only one.
    </p><p>
    <center>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="1">
    <tr><td><pre>
/* Returns the product of the two given integers, which are assumed
** to be nonnegative.  (Well, m can be negative!)
*/
public static int productOf(int m, int n) {


}</pre>
    </td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>
  </li>
</ol>
