<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks and Exercises from Chapter 5</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.1 (whileLoops)</b>:
    Given are several while-loops; for each one you are to indicate
    how many times it will iterate.  
    </p><p>
    The unfortunate notation <tt>x += 10</tt> is shorthand for 
    <tt>x = x + 10</tt>.  Similarly, <tt>x *= x</tt> is shorthand for
    <tt>x = x * x</tt>.  Please never use any among the <tt>+=</tt>,
    <tt>-=</tt>, <tt>*=</tt>, or <tt>/=</tt> operators in your own 
    programming.
    </p><p>
    The less objectionable notation <tt>max--</tt> is shorthand for
    <tt>max = max - 1</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.3 (whileLoopMystery1)</b>:
    Given is a method containing a while-loop and having a formal parameter
    <tt>x</tt>.  For each of several calls to the method (with different
    parameter values being passed to it), show the output that results.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.4 (whileLoopMystery2)</b>:
    Similar to Self-Check 5.3.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.14 (logicExpressions2)</b>:
    Given are several boolean expressions involving variables with
    given values. For each one, indicate its value (true or false).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.27 (assertions1)</b>:
     Given is a method with formal parameters <tt>console</tt> 
     (which is a <tt>Scanner</tt> object) and <tt>x</tt> (an integer),
     and local variables <tt>y</tt> and <tt>count</tt> (both integers).
     </p><p>
     Five different "points" in the code, named A through D, are 
     identified using comments.  For each of the five points and each
     of three conditions (<tt>y&lt;x</tt>, <tt>y==0</tt>, and
     <tt>count&gt;0</tt>), you are to indicate whether, when
     execution reaches that point, that condition will necessarily
     be <b>true</b> (<tt>ALWAYS</tt>), necessarily be <b>false</b>
     (<tt>NEVER</tt>), or can possibly be <b>true</b> but also possibly 
     be <b>false</b> (<tt>SOMETIMES</tt>).
     </p><p>
     Note that the statement <tt>y = console.nextInt()</tt> reads an
     integer value from the input source and stores it in <tt>y</tt>.
     As a result, the value of <tt>y</tt> can be any value of type
     <tt>int</tt>, the values in which go from approximately -2 billion
     to +2 billion.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 5.18 (digitSum)</b>:
     Develop a method <tt>digitSum(int n)</tt> that, given an integer
     <tt>n</tt>, returns the sum of the digits in 
     (the decimal representation of) n.  
     </p><p>
     Recall that you can obtain the one's digit of an integer by
     dividing it by 10 and taking the remainder.  To "chop off" the
     one's digit of an integer, divide it by 10.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 5.19 (firstDigit)</b>:
     Develop a method <tt>firstDigit(int n)</tt> that, given an integer
     <tt>n</tt>, returns the first (i.e., most significant) digit in 
     (the decimal representation of) n.  
     </p><p>
     Recall that you can obtain the one's digit of an integer by
     dividing it by 10 and taking the remainder.  To "chop off" the
     one's digit of an integer, divide it by 10.
  </li>
  </p><p>

  <!--
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.12 (printLetters)</b>:
     Develop method <tt>printLetters(String text)</tt> that prints the 
     letters in the given string, separated by dashes.  
     This raises a fencepost issue.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  -->
</ol>

</p><p>
<h3>Activity #2: In which you submit work!</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.10 (zeroDigits)</b>:
     Develop method <tt>zeroDigits(int n)</tt> that returns the number of 
     0's in the decimal representation of n.  
     As suggested in the problem statement, this problem is better-suited
     to the use of a <tt>do-while</tt> loop (which we haven't yet covered
     in class) than to a <tt>while</tt> loop, but it can be solved with
     either.  (The only problem with using a <tt>while</tt> loop arises
     when <tt>n</tt> is zero.)
     </p><p>
     Recall that you can obtain the one's digit of an integer by
     dividing it by 10 and taking the remainder.  To "chop off" the
     one's digit of an integer, divide it by 10.

  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 5.15 (isVowel)</b>:
     Develop a method <tt>isVowel(String s)</tt> that determines
     whether or not the <tt>String</tt> passed to it contains 
     nothing but a single vowel, in either upper or lower case.
     The (lowercase) vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
     </p><p>
     <b>Hint:</b> A clever way to do this involves use of the
        <tt>String</tt> class's <tt>indexOf()</tt> method.
        The <tt>Character.toUpperCase()</tt>  
        (or <tt>Character.toLowerCase()</tt>) could also be useful.

  <li>(Optional; If you have the time and inclination!)<br />
    <b>BJP4 Self-Check 5.16 (isPrime)</b>:
    Given is a flawed method <tt>isPrime()</tt> that (is intended to)
    determines whether or not the value passed to it is prime.
    You are to fix it.
    </p><p>
    <b>Hint:</b> Recalling our discussion in class of the 
    <tt>stringEquals()</tt> method (or whatever we called it) may help
    you to identify the mistake in the given code.
    </p><p>
    Besides having a logic error, the given method has at least one more
    "deficiency": it is very inefficient.  Consider that, as written,
    it will, if the value of <tt>n</tt> happens to be prime, evaluate the
    expression <tt>n % i</tt> for values of <tt>i</tt> from 2 all the way
    through <tt>n-1</tt>.  But there is no need to have <tt>i</tt> 
    go anywhere near that high, because if <tt>n</tt> is not prime,
    its smallest divisor (other than 1) must be far less than <tt>n-1</tt>.
    </p><p>
    Use your mathematical intuition to come up with a number K (which will
    depend upon the value of <tt>n</tt>, of course) that is smaller than
    <tt>n-1</tt> but is such that <tt>n</tt> is guaranteed to have a divisor
    in the range 2..K (assuming, of course, that <tt>n</tt> is not prime).
    Then adjust the source code of <tt>isPrime()</tt> so that, if it finds
    no divisors in the range 2..K, it returns <tt>true</tt>.
    </p><p>
    <b>Hint:</b> Divisors of a number come in pairs.  For example,
    (1,72), (2,36), (3,24), (4,18), (6,12), and (8,9) are the "divisor pairs"
    of 72.
