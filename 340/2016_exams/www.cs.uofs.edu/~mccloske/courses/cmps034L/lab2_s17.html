<h2>CMPS 034L &nbsp; Spring 2017<br />
Lab #2: Methods, Flow of Control, Procedural Decomposition</h2>


</p><p>
You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students are attending.

</p><p>
Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button.
Then click on the link labeled <b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP Chapter 1</b>.

<hr>
<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks</h3>
</p><p>
Do the following Self-Checks and, when finished, show your GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed all of them correctly. 
(Go back to the web page that lists all the Chapter 1 Self-Checks and refresh
it.  Any that were answered correctly will be indicated on the page.)

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.21 (methodHeaderSyntax)</b>:
      Which of the given method headers is correctly formed?
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do at least one among <b>BJP4 Self-Checks 1.22, 1.23, and 1.24</b>
      (<b>Strange, Strange2, and Strange3</b>, respectively): All these
      check your understanding of how method calls influence flow of control
      in a program.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>Do at least one among <b>BJP4 Self-Checks 1.26, 1.27, and 1.28</b>
      (<b>Confusing, Confusing2, and Confusing3</b>, respectively): 
      All of these check your understanding of how method calls influence 
      flow of control in a program.
      </p><p>
      Recall that execution of a Java application always
      begins in the method <tt>main()</tt>.  Also, the order in which
      methods appear in a Java class is irrelevant (at least with respect
      to the behavior that it produces).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.29 (LotsOfErrors-errors)</b>:
      Given a small Java application with several syntax errors,
      you are to fix them.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.30 (javaClub)</b>:
      Given a small Java application and several descriptions of
      code modifications, indicate, for each modification, whether or not
      it introduces a syntax error and, if not, whether or not it changes
      the behavior of the program. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #2: Practice-It Exercises</h3>

</p><p>
These two exercises are to help you learn how to employ the related
techniques of procedural decomposition and code redundancy removal/avoidance
when developing Java programs.

</p><p>
For each exercise, complete it and use the <b>Submit/Review</b> link below
to submit it to your instructor.  Make sure that you include comments in
your submitted program that identify ALL members of your team (which should
usually be of size two).
(You may then want to use the link again to verify that you have submitted it).
</p><p>
Because you will want to use Practice-It's correctness checker to verify
that your program works as intended, but you need to store your program
in a file before you can submit it to your instructor, 
you will want to use copy-and-paste operations to transfer your code 
between the Practice-It window and, say, a jGrasp window.
To be safe, after transferring code to a jGrasp window, you should
not only save it in a file but also compile and run it just to make
sure that the code was transferred into the jGrasp window correctly.
</p><p>
Make sure to include a comment at the beginning of your program
indicating the names of both you and your lab partner(s).

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 1.13 (StarFigures)</b>:
      <font size="+1">
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab2_dir">Submit/Review</a>.
      </font>
      <br />
      For your convenience, rather than having to enter the program from
      scratch, <a href="StarFigures.java">click here</a> to get a very
      bad solution, which you should modify extensively before submitting.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 1.16 (Shining)</b>:
      <font size="+1">
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab2_dir">Submit/Review</a>.
      </font>
      <br />
      In case you have done some programming before, note that
      you <b>are not</b> to make use of any loops in your solution
      to this exercise.
      </p><p>
      To give you a hint as to how to think about solving the
      problem posed here, examine the Java program
      <a href="Glorp15.java">Glorp15</a>, which prints a silly 
      message 15 times.
  </li>
</ol>
