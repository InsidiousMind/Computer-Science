<h2>CMPS 034L &nbsp; Spring 2017<br />
Lab #10: Arrays and (Instance) Classes
</h2>

</p><p>
You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students is present.

</p><p>
Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button,
then on the link labeled <b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>,
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP4 Chapter 7</b>.

</p><p>
<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Exercises from Chapter 7</h3>

</p><p>
Here you are asked to develop several Java methods that pertain to arrays.
Place your final version of each method (after either Practice-It's
feedback mechanism has deemed it to be error-free or you've given up on
it) into a Java class called <tt>Lab10</tt>.  At the end, 
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab10_dir">submit</a> it.

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 7.1 (lastIndexOf)</b>:
    Develop a <tt>lastIndexOf()</tt> method for finding, within an array
    of <tt>int</tt> values, the highest-numbered location of an occurrence
    of a given <tt>int</tt> value (or -1 if there is no such occurrence).  
    </p><p>
    Here's what an <tt>indexOf()</tt> method would look like:
    <center> 
    <table border="2" cellpadding="4">
    <tr><td>
<pre>/* Returns lowest-numbered location at which the given value (key) 
** occurs in the given array, or -1 if there are no such occurrences.
*/
public static int indexOf(int[] a, int key) {
   int i = 0;
   while (i != a.length  &amp;&amp;  a[i] != key) { i++; }  
   if (i == a.length) { return -1; }
   else {return i; }
}</pre>    
    </td></tr>
    </table>
    </center>
    </p><p>
    Your <tt>lastIndexOf()</tt> method body can be a little simpler,
    because, once the loop has terminated, there should be no need to 
    perform any comparison involving <tt>i</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 7.2 (range)</b>:
    Develop a <tt>range()</tt> method that, given an array of <tt>int</tt>
    values, returns the difference between the largest and smallest elements,
    plus one.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Execise 7.3 (countInRange)</b>:
    Develop a <tt>countInRange()</tt> method that, given an array of 
    <tt>int</tt> values, plus two <tt>int</tt> values defining a range,
    determines how many of the array elements lie in the range.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Execise 7.4 (isSorted)</b>:
    Develop an <tt>isSorted()</tt> method that, given an array of 
    <tt>double</tt> values, determines whether or not the array elements
    are in nondecreasing (i.e., ascending) order.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Execise 7.11 (isUnique)</b>:
    Develop an <tt>isUnique()</tt> method that, given an array of 
    <tt>int</tt> values, determines whether or not the array elements
    are unique, meaning that no value occurs more than once.
    A good approach would make use of the <tt>lastIndexOf()</tt>
    method that you developed earlier (or the <tt>indexOf()</tt>
    method that was provided).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Execise 7.15 (collapse)</b>:
    Develop a <tt>collapse()</tt> method that, given an array of 
    <tt>int</tt> values, returns a new array of <tt>int</tt> values
    of half the length of the given array.  For each i, the element 
    at location i of the new array should contain the sum of the 
    elements at locations 2i and 2i+1 of the given array.
    (Thus, pairs of adjacent elements of the given array have been
    "collapsed" into single elements of the new array.)
  </li>
</ol>

Don't forget to 
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab10_dir">submit</a>
your <tt>Lab10</tt> Java class containing all the methods that you
just completed.  Also make sure to include comments in the class that
identify all members of the team on which you worked.

<h3>Activity #2: PersonName class</h3>

</p><p>
Download the <a href="PersonName.java">PersonName</a> class and
complete it.  Use jGrasp's Workbench feature to create instances
of the class (using both constructors) and then to invoke the
observer methods to verify that everything seems to be working
correctly.

</p><p>
When finished, 
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab10_dir">submit</a>
your <tt>PersonName</tt> source code (i.e., the .java file).
