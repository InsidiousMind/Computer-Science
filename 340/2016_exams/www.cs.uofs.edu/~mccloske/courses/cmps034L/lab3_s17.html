<h2>CMPS 034L &nbsp; Spring 2017<br />
Lab #3: Expressions, Variables, Assignment</h2>

</p><p>
You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students are attending.

</p><p>
Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button.
Then click on the link labeled <b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP Chapter 2</b>.

<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks</h3>
</p><p>
Do the following Self-Checks and, when finished, show your GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed all of them correctly. 
(Go back to the web page that lists all the Chapter 2 Self-Checks and refresh
it.  Any that were answered correctly will be indicated on the page.)

</p><p>
Several of the self-checks involve evaluating one or more arithmetic
expressions.  Keep in mind the rules that govern the order in which
operators are applied, which are explained in the Reges &amp; Stepp
textbook on pages 70-73.  Unary operators (as in <tt>-13</tt> or <tt>+9</tt>)
have highest precedence, followed by the (binary) multiplicative operators
(<tt>*</tt>, <tt>/</tt>, and <tt>%</tt>), followed by the (binary)
additive operators (<tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt>).  Consecutive operators 
of the same precedence are applied from left to right.
</p><p>
Also keep in mind that if both operands of a division operator (<tt>/</tt>)
are of type <tt>int</tt>, the result is also of type <tt>int</tt>.

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.1 (legalIntLiterals)</b>:
      Identify which of the given expressions is a well-formed 
      literal of type <tt>int</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.2 (evaluatingExpressions)</b>:
      Evaluate the given expression.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.3 (expressions1)</b>:
      Evaluate at least half of the given expressions.  There are a bunch!
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.4 (expressions2)</b>:
      Evaluate at least half of the given expressions.  There are a bunch!
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.5 (expressions3)</b>:
      Evaluate at least half of the given expressions.  There are a bunch!
      <br />
      Keep in mind that the plus operator (<tt>+</tt>) refers to
      String concatenation, rather than addition, if either of its
      operands is of type <tt>String</tt>.  In that case, the
      non-String operand is "converted" to a value of type
      <tt>String</tt> before the operation is carried out.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.6 (declareRealNumberSyntax)</b>:
      Identify the line of code that declares and initializes 
      a variable as specified.
  </li>
  <!--
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.7 (fitnessVariables)</b>:
     The given instructions need a little clarification:
     The intent is that <b>age</b> and <b>weight</b> will be measured in
     whole years and pounds, respectively, while <b>gender</b> will be a
     character (e.g., <tt>F</tt> or <tt>M</tt>) and <b>height</b> will be
     a real number.
  </li>
  -->
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.9 (lastDigitExpression)</b>:
      It's odd that the instructions say to use "division and modulus"
      when only the latter is needed.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.10 (Oops2-errors)</b>:
      Correct the (mostly) syntax errors in the given Java program.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.11 (digitExpressions)</b>:
      This is similar to Self-Check 2.9, but here you <b>do</b> need
      to use <b>both</b> division (<tt>/</tt>) and modulus (<tt>%</tt>).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.12 (valueOfX)</b>:
     Given a sequence of assignments to variable <tt>x</tt>, what is
     its value immediately thereafter?
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.13 (valuesOfABC)</b>:
     Given a sequence of assignments to variables <tt>a</tt>,
     <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>c</tt>, what are their values immediately 
     thereafter?
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP Self-Check 2.14 (firstSecond)</b>:
     Given a sequence of assignments to variables <tt>first</tt> and
     <tt>second</tt>, what are their values immediately thereafter?
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #2: Displacement</h3>

</p><p>
This exercise is to give you practice in declaring variables,
assigning values to them, and developing arithmetic expressions.

</p><p>
Do BJP4 Exercise 2.1 (displacement).  Take the code that you provided as a
solution and, using jGrasp, paste it into the <tt>main()</tt> method of the
Java application <a href="DisplacementZZ.java">Displacment</a>.  
Also insert a comment to identify all members of your lab group.

</p><p>
Compile and run the program to make sure that it works. 
Then use the following link to submit it (and later review it):
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab3_dir">Submit/Review</a>.

<h3>Activity #3: Lengths</h3>

</p><p>
This exercise is to give you practice in formulating 
arithmetic expressions and in using methods.
It is similar in nature to the <tt>BMICalculator3</tt> application
discussed in lecture.  Note that the program's use of "global" variables 
(which is generally frowned upon) is something that you will be able to
avoid in the near future, after you learn how to send arguments/parameters
to a method and how to make a method return a value to its caller.

</p><p>
Given is an incomplete version of the Java application
<a href="LengthsZZ.java">Lengths</a>.  Comments that say
"<tt>CODE MISSING HERE!</tt>" indicate where code should be 
inserted in order to get the program working as intended.
The program is intended to prompt the user to enter a
positive integer representing a length, measured in inches.
After reading the user's response, the program displays two alternative
ways of expressing the same length.

</p><p>
For example, here's what the user-computer dialog should look like
(with user input in boldface) if the user were to enter 147 in response
to the prompt:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td><pre>Enter length in inches:><b>147</b>
12.25 feet
12 full feet and 3 residual inches</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Complete the program and, when it is working as intended, 
use the following link to submit it (and later review it):
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab3_dir">Submit/Review</a>.
