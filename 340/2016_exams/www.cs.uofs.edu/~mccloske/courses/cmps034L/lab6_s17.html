<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Exercises from Chapter 3</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 3.18 (vertical)</b>:
     You are to develop a method that, given a String, prints its
     characters vertically (i.e., one per line).
     <br />
     <b>Hint:</b> Use a for-loop and the <tt>charAt()</tt> method.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 3.19 (printReverse)</b>:
     You are to develop a method that, given a String, prints its
     characters in reverse order.
     <br />
     <b>Hint:</b> Use a for-loop (having a loop control variable whose value
     decreases on each iteration) and the <tt>charAt()</tt> method.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 3.17 (padString)</b>:
     You are to develop a functional method that, given a String and a
     desired length, returns the String obtained by padding the given 
     one with as many leading spaces as necessary to reach the desired
     length.
     </p><p>
     How many times should your loop iterate?  Use the String concatenation
     operator (<tt>+</tt>).
     </p><p>
     Note that your solution to this exercise is needed for the next activity.
  </li>

<h3>Activity #3: Self-Checks and Exercises from Chapter 4</h3>

</p><p>
Now move to the Chapter 4 Self-Checks by clicking on the "Problems"
link near top of the page (directly under the "Practice-It logo)
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP Chapter 4</b>.

</p><p>
<ol>
  <li>(Optional: skip to next task unless you're moving quickly.)<br />
    <b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.4 (Oops4-errors)</b>:
    Correct several errors in a Java program involving a functional method
    and a couple of if-statements.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.5 (ifElseMystery1)</b>:
      Given a method involving if-else statements and calls to it,
      show the output produced.  Recall that <tt>y++</tt> is a
      shorthand way of saying <tt>y = y+1</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>(Optional: skip to next task unless you're moving quickly.)<br />
  <b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.16 (countFactors)</b>:
      Correct a flawed method having as its purpose to compute the
      number of divisors of a given number.  (The problem uses the
      term 'factor', but 'divisor' is more accurate.)
      </p><p>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.18 (doubleSumError)</b>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.20 (charMystery)</b>:
      Recall that the statement <tt>letter++</tt> increases the value
      of variable <tt>letter</tt> by one.  Keep in mind that values of
      type <tt>char</tt> are pseudo-integers in the sense that each
      of them is associated to an integer value that represents it.
      Thus, for example, if <tt>letter</tt> has value <tt>'D'</tt>, then
      execution of <tt>letter++</tt> changes its value to <tt>'E'</tt>
      (because the number that represents <tt>'E'</tt> is one greater
      than the number that represents <tt>'D'</tt>).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.21 (capitalLetter)</b>:
     Develop an if-else statement that reports whether or not a 
     particular variable has as its value a String that begins 
     with an upper case letter. 
     Make use of the method <tt>Character.isUpperCase()</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.23 (lastFirst)</b>:
     Develop a method that translates a name in the form first-space-last
     (e.g., "<tt>Chris Glorphead</tt>") into the form 
     last-comma-space-initial (e.g., "<tt>Glorphead, C.</tt>").
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.25 (printTriangleTypePreconditions)</b>:
     Identify the preconditions appropriate for a method that receives
     &mdash;via its parameters&mdash; 
     the lengths of the three sides of a triangle.
     The method was written under the assumption that the three values
     it receives are the lengths of the sides of a real triangle
     (as opposed to an "impossible" triangle).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>(Optional: skip to next task unless you're moving quickly.)<br />
      <b>BJP4 Self-Check 4.27 (medianOf3)</b>:
     Correct a flawed method having as its purpose to compute the
     median of the three numbers passed to it via its parameters.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 4.3 (season)</b>:
     Develop a method that takes parameters describing a calendar date
     (just month and day, no year) and returns a String indicating in 
     which season it falls (e.g., "<tt>Winter</tt>", "<tt>Summer</tt>").
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li>(Optional: skip to next task unless you're moving quickly.)<br />
      <b>BJP4 Exercise 4.19 (quadrant)</b>:
     Develop a method that receives a pair of real numbers representing
     a point on the cartesian plane and returns a value indicating
     in which of the quadrants the point lies.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 4.4 (daysInMonth)</b>:
     Develop a method that receives an <tt>int</tt> parameter indicating 
     a month (e.g., <tt>3</tt> for March, <tt>11</tt> for November) 
     and returns the number of days in that month.
     (Assume that February always has 28 days.)
     Rather than developing a 12-branch if-else statement (one branch
     for each month), try to use Java's OR operator (<tt>||</tt>) to form 
     compound conditions so as to keep the number of branches at three
     (one for each possible # of days in a month, 28, 30, or 31).
     </p><p>
     Note that your solution to this exercise is needed for the next activity.

<h3>Activity #4: In which you submit work!</h3>

</p><p>
Complete the first version of the <tt>daysInMonth()</tt> method
in the Java class <a href="MonthDaysZZ.java">MonthDays</a> and
use this
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab6_dir">Submit/Review</a> 
link to submit it.
If you are ambitious, complete the second version of the method, too,
in which leap years are taken into account.
Don't be afraid to have the second version of the method call the
first one in all but the case of a leap day having to be accounted for.
