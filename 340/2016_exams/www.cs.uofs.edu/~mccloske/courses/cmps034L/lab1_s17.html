<h2>CMPS 034L &nbsp; Spring 2017<br />Lab #1: Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Activity #1: Register on course web page</h3>
</p><p>
In order to submit the work that you do in CMPS 134 and CMPS 034L
to be graded (e.g., files containing Java programs), 
you must complete a simple registration process.
If you haven't already done that, follow these instructions:

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/courses/cmps134/index_s17.html"
       target="_blank">Click here</a> to go to the CMPS 134 course web page.
       <br /><b>Note:</b> 
       It would make things easier if you went to the CMPS 134 page in a
       brand new browser window, rather than in a new tab in the same window, 
       which is what you will get by clicking on the given link.
       In the Firefox browser, if you right click on the link, you can
       then choose to open it in a new Firefox window.  <b>End of note.</b>
  </li>
  <li>Select (under the heading <b>Student Functions</b>) the hyperlink 
      labeled <b>Register</b>.
  </li>
  <li>In the text box on the web page that appears, enter your Royal Number
      (upper case 'R' followed by eight digits), and click on the
      <b>Submit Form</b> button.
  </li>
  <li>On the page that appears ("Registration Page"), you must enter a 
      password (two times).  (It is important that you remember it, of
      course.) If you wish, you can enter the other pieces of 
      personal data requested, but these are optional.
      Then click on the <b>Submit Form</b> button.  
  </li>
  <li>The page that pops up should verify that you registered by saying,
      among other things, "Authorization completed!!!".
      But you should verify it yourself by navigating back to the 
      course web page (e.g., using the browser's BACK button three times
      should do it) and clicking on the <b>View Class Roster</b> hyperlink.
      On the page that appears, your name should be among those on the list
      that is displayed when you click on the "Select" drop-down menu.
  </li>
</ol>

<hr>
<h3>Activity #2: Submit background information</h3>
</p><p>
Take five minutes to compose a brief description of your experience
using computing devices.  In particular, if you've ever done any
computer programming, indicate how much, in what context (e.g., a
course in high school), and in which programming language(s).
</p><p>
CMPS 134 is an introductory course, so don't be concerned if you
barely even know what "programming" means.  Typically, more than half
the students enrolled in the course have never programmed before.
</p><p>
Use Wordpad, MS Word, or some similar document editing tool
to prepare your description.  (Or you can wait until installing
<b>jGrasp</b> in the next activity and then use its editing
capabilities to do it.)
It need only be a paragraph or two in length, but it is expected 
to be well written (i.e., using proper grammar and coherent sentences),
such as would be expected of any capable college student.
</p><p>
When you have finished, submit your file by 
<a href="http://www.cs.scranton.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&amp;dir=cmps134&amp;sub=lab1_dir" target="_blank">clicking here</a> 
and following these instructions:   
</p><p>
The web page that pops up should invite you to log in.  Use the
"Select" drop down menu to find your name, choose it, then
enter your password where appropriate and click the "SUBMIT FORM"
button.  The page that should appear says <b>Submit Page</b> at the top.
(This awkward phrase is meant to indicate that this is a web page to be
used for submitting work to your instructor.)
</p><p>
You can enter a "Title" and/or a "Message" in the text boxes labeled
as such, but that is not necessary.  What is important is that you
click on any of the "Browse" buttons underneath the "Message" box, 
select the file containing the document you just prepared, 
and then click on the "SUBMIT FORM" button.  
<p><p>
You should get a "message submitted!!!" message.
Use the web browser's BACK button to go back one page, and then
refresh that page (by clicking on the refresh icon) (and telling
the browser to "resend" if it asks).  There should be a hyperlink
on the page to what is now your instructor's copy of the file that
you just submitted.  You can click on it, which will cause the file
to be downloaded onto your computer, if you want to verify that it
is, indeed, a copy of the file that you submitted.

<h3>Activity #3: Installing Java JDK and jGrasp</h3>
<ol>
  <li>To install the <b>Java Development Kit</b> (JDK):
    <ul>
      <li>click <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html"
                 target="_blank">here</a>.
          On the page that pops up, click the big button (near top left of page)
          with the word "Java" in it with the image of a cup of coffee to its left.
      </li>
      <li>On the page that pops up, look in the section headed by the phrase
          <b>Java SE Development Kit 8u121</b> to find the <b>Product/File Description</b>
          (left column) appropriate for your computer.  If you have an Apple computer,
          that would most likely be <b>Mac OS X</b>.  If you have a computer that runs under 
          Windows, it would probably be <b>Windows x64</b> (but if you have an old
          "32-bit" machine, it would be <b>Windows x86</b>).
          Click on the corresponding link in the <b>Download</b> column in order
          to download the installation program. 
      </li>
      <li>Now run the installation program (e.g., by double clicking on the icon
          representing that program).  During the installation process,
          you'll need to accept the license agreement and make some choices
          as to settings.  For the latter, you are encouraged to choose the
          defaults.
          </p><p>
          Take notice of the step that shows precisely where (i.e., in which
          folder/subdirectory) in your computer's file system Java is being
          installed.  On a Windows machine, most likely it will be in
          <b><tt>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk?????</tt></b>, where the ?'s refer
          to the exact version number of JDK that you are installing.
          When installation has finished, this folder will have a folder
          within it named "bin" that contains (executable) files named
          <tt>javac.exe</tt> and <tt>java.exe</tt>, which are the Java compiler
          and the JRE (Java Runtime Environment?), respectively.  If you can
          find these files in this location, you can be reasonably sure that
          you've completed this step correctly.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To install <b>jGrasp</b>:<br />
      Click <a href="http://www.jgrasp.org" target="_blank">here</a>.
      Near the upper right corner of the page that appears will be a link 
      labeled <b>Download jGRASP</b>.  Click on it, and on the resulting
      page scroll down a little to find the section indicating
      <b>jGrasp 2.0.3_05</b>.  Depending upon your computer's operating
      system, click on the appropriate green button to download an 
      installation program.  Then run it!  (If your computer runs under
      Linux, you'll first have to "unzip" the compressed installation
      program file.)
      </p><p>
      Again you may need to accept the license agreement and you are 
      encouraged to accept the default settings as you proceed.  
  </li>
  <li>Verify that the previous steps were successful by downloading,
      compiling, and executing the 
      <a href="HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld</a> Java application program.
      Before doing that, you may want to create a folder/subdirectory
      on your computer's file system specifically for storing files
      relevant to this course.
      </p><p>
      Having downloaded the <tt>HelloWorld.java</tt> file, click on 
      its icon.  Depending upon your computer's settings, the file may 
      be loaded into jGrasp automatically.  Or it might ask you to 
      choose an application in which to load the file, in which case you
      should choose jGrasp.
      </p><p>
      Once you've got the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> program loaded into
      jGrasp, compile and run it.  (To compile, click on the button
      that looks like a green cross.  To run, click on the button
      to its right, which looks like a humanoid stick figure in the
      act of running.)
      </p><p>
      After you've run the program successfully, insert a new
      statement immediately after (or before) the statement that
      prints <tt>Hello, World</tt> and have the new statement
      print some other message.  Compile and run the updated
      program.  Show the TA that you have done this!
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #4: Create Practice-It Account</h3>
</p><p>
Assuming that you haven't yet created an account for yourself on
the <b>Practice-It</b> web site, click 
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">here</a>
and, on the page that pops up, click on the <b>Create Account</b> button.  
You will have to provide some personal information (e.g., name,
e-mail address, school) and, more importantly, choose a username 
and password. 
</p><p>
If you are sensitive about your privacy, you can provide a fictitious 
name, although your e-mail address probably gives it away, anyway!
And you will need to provide your e-mail address, because the Practice-It
system sends you an e-mail via which you must verify that you are trying
to create an account.)

<hr>
<h3>Activity #5: Practice-It Exercises</h3>
</p><p>
For this activity, you should work in groups of two.

</p><p>
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">
Go to the Practice-It web site</a>, log in, and click on the 
<b>Start Practicing</b> button.  Then click on the link labeled 
<b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b> and then on the
link indicating <b>BJP4 Chapter 1</b>.
</p><p>
Do the following <b>Practice-It Self-Checks</b> and, when finished,
show your GTA (graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed
all of them correctly.  (Go back to the web page that lists all
the Chapter 1 Self-Checks and refresh it.  Any that were answered
correctly will be indicated on the page.)

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.1 (binaryNumbers)</b>:
      Oops!  Your instructor forgot to prepare you for the question posed
      here.  But I'm sure that you can get the right answer in no more than
      three guesses, as only three of the choices are plausible.
      Anyway, all the Self-Checks at the end of any chapter are based on 
      the material in that chapter.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.2 (binary1)</b>:
      Converting decimal numerals into the equivalent binary numerals.
      (Note that the author of this question fails to make the proper 
      distinction between "number" and "numeral", which is a common
      oversight.)
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.3 (binary2)</b>:
      Converting binary numerals into equivalent decimal numerals.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.5 (javaVsClass)</b>: 
      Oops again.  But the answer is in Chapter 1, of course.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.6 (legalIdentifiers)</b>: 
      In Java, an <b>identifier</b> (which is a name that a programmer gives
      to an entity such as a class or a method) can include only letters 
      (i.e., any of <tt>a..z</tt> or <tt>A..Z</tt>), digits 
      (i.e., any of <tt>0..9</tt>), underscores (i.e., <tt>_</tt>), and 
      dollar signs (i.e., <tt>$</tt>).  
      But it cannot begin with a digit.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.7 (outputSyntax)</b>:
      Compare the candidate answers to the posed question with the
      statement in the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> program that prints the
      "Hello, World" message.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.8 (confounding)</b>
      Recall that <tt>\"</tt> and <tt>\\</tt> are <b>escape sequences</b> 
      that, when appearing within a literal string, translate to the 
      characters <b><tt>"</tt></b> and <b><tt>\</tt></b>, respectively.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.10 (Shaq)</b>: Escape sequences again.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.13 (Sally)</b>: 
      Developing <tt>println</tt> statements that print strings
      in which the <b><tt>"</tt></b> and <b><tt>\</tt></b> characters
      appear.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.18 (MyProgram-errors)</b>:
      Detecting and correcting syntax errors.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 1.19 (SecretMessage-errors)</b>:
      Detecting and correcting syntax errors.
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
Remember, before leaving show your GTA that you've correctly answered 
all the Self-Checks assigned above.
