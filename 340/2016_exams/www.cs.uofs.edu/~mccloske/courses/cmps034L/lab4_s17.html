Lab #4: for-loops and methds with parameters</h2>

</p><p>
You are to work in groups of two, with one group of three in the
case that an odd number of students are attending.

Go to the
<a href="http://practiceit.cs.washington.edu" target="_blank">Practice-It 
website</a>, log in, and click on the <b>Start Practicing</b> button.

<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks and Exercises on for-loops</h3>
After logging in to Practice-It, click on the link labeled 
<b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP Chapter 2</b>.

</p><p>
Do the following Self-Checks and, when finished, show your GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed all of them correctly. 
(Go back to the web page that lists all the Chapter 2 Self-Checks and
refresh it.
Any that were answered correctly will be indicated on the page.)

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.26 (fingerTrap)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java code segment
      involving a for-loop.  Recall that <b><tt>\\</tt></b> is an 
      "escape sequence" that evaluates to the character <b><tt>\</tt></b>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.27 (howManyLines)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java for-loop.
      The notation <tt>i++</tt> is a shorthand way of saying <tt>i = i + 1</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.28 (blastOff)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java code segment
      involving a for-loop. 
      The notation <tt>i--</tt> is a shorthand way of saying <tt>i = i - 1</tt>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.29 (multiplication)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java for-loop
      (that has a loop nested inside it). 
      The notation <tt>j++</tt> is a shorthand way of saying <tt>j = j + 1</tt>.
      Don't forget the difference between the behaviors of 
      <tt>System.out.print()</tt> and <tt>System.out.println()</tt>
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.30 (nestedLoops)</b>: (optional)
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java program.
      The figure that it "draws" should be familiar to you from our
      recent lecture.
      The <tt>++</tt> operator is as mentioned above.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.24 (oddStuff)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java code segment
      involving a for-loop.<br />
      What is tricky here is that the upper bound of the range of 
      values through which the loop control variable (<tt>count</tt>) 
      iterates is defined by a variable (<tt>number</tt>) whose value 
      changes from one loop iteration to the next.
      For this reason, I would argue that this is an inappropriate use
      of a for-loop.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.31 (starExclamation1)</b>:
      Show output produced by the execution of a given Java code segment
      involving for-loops nested three levels deep.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.32 (starExclamation2)</b>:
      Same as previous problem, except that the statement that
      prints an exclamation point is no longer in the body of
      the loop nested one level deep.
  </li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 2.33 (starExclamation3)</b>:
      Same as previous problem, except that the statement that
      prints an exclamation point is now in the body of
      the most deeply-nested loop.
  </li>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 2.6 (numberTriangle)</b>:
      Develop a pair of for-loops, one nested in the other, that
      "draws" the given right triangle.
      Not surprisingly, code for doing this will closely resemble
      that in the <tt>drawRightTriangle()</tt> method in any version
      of the <tt>DrawFiguresWithLoops</tt> application (to which there
      are links on the course web page).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Activity #2: Practice-It Self-Checks on methods with parameters</h3>
Click on the "Problems" link near the top of any Practice-It page on
which a self-check or exercise is described.  That should take you to
a page from which you can maneuver to the BJP4 Chapter 3 Self-Checks.
Go there.

</p><p>
Do the following Self-Checks and, when finished, show your GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed all of them correctly. 
(Go back to the web page that lists all the Chapter 3 Self-Checks
and refresh it.  
Any that were answered correctly will be indicated on the page.)

<ol>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.1 (methodHeaderSyntax)</b>:
      Identify which of the given method headings is syntactically valid.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.2 (MysteryNums)</b>:
      Show the output produced by the given Java program, which involves
      calls to a method with parameters.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.4 (Odds)</b>:
      Similar to previous self-check.
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>

<h3>Activity #3: In which you submit stuff!</h3>

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.10 (printStrings)</b>:
     Write a method that accepts parameters.
     Take the code that you provided as a solution and paste it into the
     <a href="PrintStringsApp.java">PrintStringsApp</a> Java application.
     Also insert a comment to identify all members of your lab group.
     Compile and run the program to make sure that it works. 
     Then use the following link to submit it (and then to verify that
     it was submitted):
     <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab4_dir">Submit/Review</a>.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 2.8 (spacesAndNumbers)</b>:
      Solve the exercise, which is to write Java code to "draw" a size 5
      right triangle, but then generalize your solution by completing
      the <a href="SpacesAndNumbersApp.java">SpacesAndNumbersApp</a>
      by providing the body of method <tt>drawTriangle()</tt>, the
      single parameter of which is for specifying the intended size
      of the figure.
      Use the following link to submit the completed program 
      (and then to verify that it was submitted):
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab4_dir">Submit/Review</a>.
