<h3>Activity #1: Practice-It Self-Checks and an Exercise from Chapter 3</h3>
After logging in to Practice-It, click on the link labeled 
<b>Building Java Programs, 4th Edition</b>
and then on the link indicating <b>BJP Chapter 3</b>.

</p><p>
Do the following Self-Checks and, when finished, show your GTA
(graduate teaching assistant) that you've completed all of them correctly. 
(Go back to the web page that lists all the Chapter 3 Self-Checks and
refresh it.
Any that were answered correctly will be indicated on the page.)

<ol>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.8 (parameterMysteryTouch)</b>:
      Show output produced by each call to the method <tt>touch()</tt>.
      <br />
      You must remember that the names of the formal parameters in a
      method have nothing to do with the names of variables that are
      used as actual parameters in a call to the method.
      It's the order in which the parameters are listed (in both the
      call and in the method heading) that determines the correspondence.
      </p><p>
      For example (as depicted in the figure below), 
      the call <tt>touch(ear, elbow)</tt> in <tt>main()</tt> results in the
      first actual parameter (<tt>ear</tt>, which has value "<tt>eye</tt>")
      being transmitted to the first formal parameter (<tt>elbow</tt>) and 
      the value of the second actual parameter (<tt>elbow</tt>, which has
      value "<tt>head</tt>") being transmitted to the second formal parameter
      (<tt>ear</tt>).  Thus, in response to this call, <tt>touch()</tt>
      will begin executing with its formal parameter <tt>elbow</tt>
      having value "<tt>eye</tt>" and its formal parameter <tt>ear</tt>
      having value "<tt>head</tt>", which are <b>opposite</b> of the
      values of the same-named variables in <tt>main()</tt>.
      </p><p>
      <center>
      <table border="2" cellpadding="4">
      <tr><td><pre>
                   +-----+             +------+
In main():     ear |"eye"|       elbow |"head"|
                   +-----+             +------+
                      |                   |
                      |                   |
                      |                   |
                      v                   v
                   +-----+            +------+
In touch():  elbow |"eye"|        ear |"head"|

  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.15 (mathExpressions2)</b>:
      Given is a sequence of Java statements that make use of 
      functional methods in the 
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html"
      target="_blank">java.lang.Math</a> class.
      The statements are to be executed one after the other.
      Show the values of the variables where indicated.
      </p><p>
      Note that a statement such as <tt>Math.sqrt(count)</tt>
      evaluates to some value, but because that value is not being assigned
      to a variable (or being used in any other way, such as as a parameter
      in a call to a method), it has no lasting effect.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.16 (min)</b>:
      Make use of the <tt>Math.min()</tt> functional method in developing 
      a functional method <tt>min()</tt> that returns the smallest of the 
      <b>three</b> integer values passed to it via parameters.
      <br />
      <b>Hint:</b> A functional method call can itself be an 
      actual parameter in a call to a method. 
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Exercise 3.6 (largerAbsVal)</b>:
      Make use of the <tt>Math.max()</tt> and <tt>Math.abs()</tt>
      functional methods in developing a functional method 
      <tt>largerAbsVal()</tt> that returns the larger of the 
      absolute values of the two integers passed to it.
      <b>Hint:</b> A functional method call can itself be an 
      actual parameter in a call to a method. 
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.17 (countQuarters)</b>:
      Develop a functional method <tt>countQuarters()</tt>.
      Make use of the division and remainder operators.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.20 (stringExpressions2)</b>:
      Evaluate each of the given expressions, which involve <tt>String</tt>
      objects and calls to methods from the 
      <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html"
      target="_blank">java.lang.String</a> class.
      The methods used here are also explained 
      <a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/courses/cmps134/string_methods.html"
      target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p><p>
      Recall that the positions in a <tt>String</tt> are <b>numbered starting
      at zero</b>, not one.
      Also, the <tt>String</tt> returned by the <tt>substring()</tt> method
      goes from the position indicated by the first parameter up to,
      <b>but not including</b>, the position indicated by the second parameter.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>BJP4 Self-Check 3.12 (Temperature-errors)</b>:
      Make corrections to the given Java program, which makes use of
      a functional method that translates a Fahrenheit temperature
      value into the equivalent on the Celsius scale.
      </p><p>
      <b>Hint:</b> 
      The most significant error is in the way that <tt>tempc</tt>
      is being used.  In particular, assigning a value to 
      formal parameter <tt>tempc</tt> inside the method <tt>ftoc()</tt>
      <b>has no effect</b> upon the actual parameter from which it
      got its initial value, which in this case happens to be
      the same-named variable in <tt>main()</tt>.  Indeed, there is 
      no point in passing <tt>tempc</tt> as a parameter to <tt>ftoc()</tt>.

<h3>Activity #2: In which you submit work!</h3>

</p><p>
Read <b>BJP4 Exercise 3.8 (quadratic)</b>.
Then download and complete the Java program 
<a href="QuadraticRootsZZ.java">QuadraticRoots</a>.
(Code is needed in each place where the comment 
<tt>// STUB!!</tt> appears.)
This program computes the roots of several quadratic (i.e., degree-2)
polynomials.  You will recall that a root of a polynomial is a value
such that, when it is substituted for x, the polynomial evaluates
to zero.  (Such a value is also sometimes called a <b>zero</b> of
the polynomial.)

</p><p>
If, after you have it working correctly, you have extra time,
modify the code so that the reported roots are rounded to the
nearest thousandth.  Use the <tt>System.out.printf()</tt> method.

</p><p>
When you have completed the program, use this
<a href="http://www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/Submit.cgi?root=spring17&dir=cmps134&sub=lab5_dir">Submit/Review</a> 
link to submit it.
