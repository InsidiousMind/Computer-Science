/* Java application that acts as a wrapper for the code to be developed
** for BJP4 Exercise 2.8 (spacesAndNumbers).
** The method drawTriangle() is to draw a right triangle whose right angle
** is at bottom right.  Its parameter is for indicating the desired height
** (i.e., number of rows) of the triangle.  The symbol used in forming 
** each row is the digit corresponding to the row number.  Thus, for example,
** a size 4 triangle looks like this:
**   
**    1
**   22
**  333
** 4444
