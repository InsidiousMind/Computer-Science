<h2>Passing command line (or "run") arguments to a Java application 
    in jGrasp
</h2>

<h3>Command Line Arguments</h3>
</p><p>
It is convenient to be able to invoke a program and to send
input data to it when doing so.  For example, the UNIX command 

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>% cp junk.txt garbage.txt</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
invokes the utility <tt>cp</tt> (the purpose of which is to make 
a copy of a file) and at the same time tells it the names of the 
"source" and "destination" files 
(<tt>junk.txt</tt> and <tt>garbage.txt</tt>, respectively).
Here, the names of the two files are the command line arguments 
being passed to the <tt>cp</tt> program.

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b>
The percent sign in the above was not entered by the user;
rather, it is a common prompt symbol in UNIX informing the
user that the operating system is awaiting a command to be entered.
<b>End of note.</b>

<h3>Java: Purpose of <tt>args[]</tt> formal parameter in <tt>main()</tt></h3>

</p><p>
Did you ever wonder why, in a Java application, the <tt>main()</tt>
method has a formal parameter <tt>args</tt> of type <tt>String[]</tt>?
It's because the command line arguments provided when the application
is executed are passed to <tt>main()</tt> via <tt>args</tt>.
Specifically, if <em>n</em> command line arguments are specified
(separated by whitespace), 
they are written into <tt>args[0]</tt>, <tt>args[1]</tt>, ...,
<tt>args[n-1]</tt>.

</p><p>
To run a Java application from the command line,
you type in something like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>% java Glork gris grop gorn</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
This invokes the Java virtual machine (named <tt>java</tt>) 
and passes to it the command line arguments 
<tt>Glork</tt>, <tt>gris</tt>, <tt>grop</tt>, and <tt>gorn</tt>.
The Java virtual machine then, in effect, invokes the 
Java application in the file <tt>Glork.class</tt> and passes 
to it the arguments <tt>gris</tt>, <tt>grop</tt>, and <tt>gorn</tt>,
so that, in the <tt>main()</tt> method of class <tt>Glork</tt>,
its formal parameter <tt>args[]</tt> is such that <tt>args.length</tt>
is three, with the elements in it having values
"<tt>gris</tt>", "<tt>grop</tt>", and "<tt>gorn</tt>", respectively.

<h3>jGrasp: How to send command line arguments</h3>

</p><p>
In jGrasp, the arguments passed to an application when it is invoked
are referred to as "run arguments".  
Here we describe how to send such arguments to a Java application
when running it from inside jGrasp.

<ol>
  <li>Make the application program to be run the current class 
      (by clicking on the window containing its source code).
  </li>
  <li>Click on <b>Build</b> (in the Menu Bar) so that the associated
      menu appears.
  </li>
  <li>Click on the <b>Run Arguments</b> box on the menu so that it has a
      checkmark in it.
      A text box should immediately appear above the application program's
      source code.
  </li>
  <li>Enter into that text box one or more run arguments, separated by
      spaces.  Do not include quote symbols unless you want them to
      be interpreted as symbols occurring in the argument itself.
  </li> 
  <li>Click on the Run icon.
  </li>
</ol>
