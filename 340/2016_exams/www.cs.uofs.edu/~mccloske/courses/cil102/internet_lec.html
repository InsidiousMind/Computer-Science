Notes on How the Internet Works
</H3>

<p>
What is the <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</A>?
It is a huge collection of inter-connected computer networks
spanning the Earth.
One might say that it is a <em>network of computer networks</em>
that serves as a communications medium.
A brief history of the Internet, written by several of those 
instrumental in developing it, can be found
<A HREF="http://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml">here</A>.
Among the services available on the Internet are
<ul>
  <li><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail">e-mail</A>:
    a means for sending and receiving messages in an
    asynchronous fashion (i.e., the receiver need not be "listening"
    at the time the sender is "sending")
  </li>
  <li><b>chat rooms</b>, <b>instant messaging</b>: 
      a means for sending and receiving messages in a 
      synchronous (i.e., interactive) fashion.
  </li>
  <li><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web</A>:
      a dynamic repository of "documents" containing
      textual, graphical, audio, and video information, as well as
      hyperlinks to related documents.
  </li> 
  <li><b>ftp</b> (file transfer protocol): 
      a means for exchanging files between
      a "local" machine and a "remote" machine.
  </li> 
  <li><b>telnet</b>: a means for logging into and carrying out a
      "session" on a remote machine.
  </li>
  <li><b>VoIP</b> (Voice over IP): in effect, telephone service
  </li>
</ul>

<H3>IP (Internet Protocol) Addresses</H3>
<p>
All the services provided by the Internet involve computers sending
<em>messages</em> back and forth to one another.  When you send an
e-mail to someone far away, the content of that e-mail somehow
is transmitted from your machine to the one where your friend's
emailbox is located.  When you click on a hyperlink on a web
page (to fetch another web page for your viewing pleasure), the
request for that web page is transmitted by your machine to the one
where the web page is stored, and the web page itself is transmitted
from that machine to yours.

<p>
In order for a message to get to its intended destination, it must be
routed there, in a manner somewhat analogous to how letters and postcards
are routed (in what has become known as "snail mail") by the 
U.S. Postal Service.  In particular, associated to each
message is a destination address, which is analogous to the
intended recipient's mailing address on a postcard/letter.
On the Internet, the addresses used are called 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">IP addresses</A>,
where IP abbreviates <b>Internet Protocol</b>.
Each device connected to the Internet has at least one
IP address, and no two devices connected (at any one time) are supposed
to share an IP address.  Each message sent on the Internet includes a
"wrapper" (analogous to the envelope in which you might place a letter) 
on which appear the IP address of the sender 
(analogous to the return address on a letter)
and the IP address of the intended recipient.

<p>
An IP address (under IP version 4, anyway) is represented by a bit string
of length 32, which is to say a sequence of four (8-bit) bytes.
By convention, to express an IP address we translate each of its 
four bytes into a decimal numeral (in the range 0 to 255, because that's
the range of values representable by 8-bit binary numerals)
and separate them by periods (or "full stops", to use the European term).
The U of S "owns" (more accurately, "rents") all the IP addresses of the
form 134.198.xxx.xxx, of which there are 65,536 !
For example, 134.198.169.34 is the IP address of one machine at the
U of S.
To ascertain the IP address (plus other characteristics) of a machine
running MS Windows XP, start up a "Command Prompt" window and
enter the command 
<p><center><tt>ipconfig /all</tt></center>

<p>
Due to the ongoing growth in the number of devices that connect to the
Internet, there will come a time when 2<sup>32</sup> IP addresses will not be
enough to go around.  Hence, since 1999 there has been a gradual deployment
of IP version 6 (or IPv6), which will eventually replace the older
IP version 4 (IPv4).
In IPv6, IP addresses are 128 bits (i.e. sixteen bytes) in length.
(Going from IPv4 (4-byte IP addresses) to IPv6 (16-byte IP addresses)
will increase the number of possible IP addresses by a factor of
2<sup>96</sup> (or approximately 10<sup>30</sup>!).

<p>
Who controls and allocates IP addresses? 
Answer: The 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority">
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (iana)</A>,
which is operated by 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers">ICANN</A>.

<!-- <A HREF="http://www.iana.org">Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (iana)</A>.  -->
A typical home user does not purchase an IP address from iana.
Rather, he relies upon an <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISP">ISP</A>
(Internet Service Provider) (i.e., a company to whom one pays a monthly fee
to get access to the Internet, typically either via 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_modem">cable modem</A>,
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSL">DSL</A>, or 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-up">dial-up</A>)
to provide an IP address.
An ISP typically purchases hundreds or thousands of IP addresses so 
that when a customer logs in, his machine can be assigned an IP address
dynamically (i.e. at that moment) from the ISP's available pool of
IP addresses.
<!-- (Notion of <b>static</b> vs. <b>dynamic</b> IP address
and <b>DHCP</b> (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).)
-->


<H3>Packets</H3>
<p>
For technical reasons, the unit of data that can be transmitted from one
machine to another via the Internet is relatively small.  This unit is
referred to as a 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_%28information_technology%29#Packets_vs._datagrams">packet</A>.
<!-- , and a network that transmits data in
   the form of packets is referred to as a <b>packet-switching network</b>.
-->
If computer <tt>A</tt> "wants" to send a message to computer <tt>B</tt>,
and that message is larger than what can "fit" into a single packet,
computer <tt>A</tt> must divide the message into multiple packets and
send each one of them to <tt>B</tt> separately. 
As <tt>B</tt> receives the individual packets, it reassembles them back 
into a single message.
(Examples of messages that <tt>A</tt> might want to send to <tt>B</tt>
are an e-mail, a file (in response to a request via ftp, for example), 
or a web page (which is itself nothing but a file).)


<!-- (A packet has an allowable maximum length and is typically about
1000 or 1500 bytes long.)
Packets are on the order of 1000 or 2000 bytes.
-->
<!-- Computers "take turns" in sending/receiving messages. -->

<p>
Using <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet 
switching</A> (as this approach is called)
prevents one machine from "hogging" the transmission
line when it is sending a large message.
(This is in contrast to the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_switching">circuit switching</A>
approach traditionally used by the telephone system, which at times of
heavy use (such as Mother's Day) sometimes responds with the dreaded
"We're sorry, but all circuits are busy.  Please try again later." message.)
(Imagine a grocery store in which every checkout line is an "express lane"
limiting the customer to, say, five items.  If you want to buy 100 items,
you are forced to go through the line twenty times, which is disadvantageous
to you but advantageous to customers buying only a few items, 
who otherwise would have to wait a long time in line behind you.)
<!-- (Analogy to Service Merchandise store: one customer's large order 
    should not hold up other customers' smaller orders.)
-->

<p>
Each packet consists of two kinds of data: <b>control information</b> and
the <b>payload</b>.  (Using our postal analogy, the former is analogous to
the information appearing on the envelope and the latter is analogous to
the letter inside the envelope.)
The control information includes a bunch of items that are useful in 
helping the network to deliver the packet (and the larger message of 
which it is a part), including 
<ul>
  <li>the IP address of the sender
      (analogous to the return address on an envelope)
  </li>
  <li>the IP address of the intended recipient
      (analogous to the mailing address on an envelope)
  </li>
  <li>error detection/correction bits that are used for determining
      whether the contents of the packet have been corrupted during
      its journey (and to correct it, if possible)
  </li>
  <li>sequencing information: Suppose that a message is composed of, say,
       27 packets.  Then each one has placed in it a number between
       1 and 27 to indicate whether it is the tenth packet of the
       message, the twenty-third, or whatever.  As the recipient receives the
       27 packets (not necessarily in the same order as they were sent,
       mind you, because of the nondeterministic nature of the Internet),
       it uses this information to reassemble the message properly.
  </li>
</ul>
The payload refers to what, from the user's point of view, is the meaningful
data (e.g., a (portion of a) web page, or e-mail message, or whatever).

<p>
Here is a hypothetical packet:
<pre>
                +------------------------------------------------+
  Control       |    Sender IP Address: 134.198.14.5             |

                |    ...                                         |
                |    ...                                         |

  (an e-mail)   |    courses (except for Computer Programming)   |
                |    and I can't seem to make any friends.       |
                |    I can hardly wait for Christmas vacation.   |
                |                                                |
                |                        Love,                   |
                |                        Mortimer                |
                +------------------------------------------------+
</pre>

<p>
Packet switching nicely "scales up" as more computers are added to a
network (and hence the volume of data being transmitted increases), 
in the sense that performance degrades slowly (rather than rapidly).

<H3>Routers</H3>
<p>
So far we've discussed the fact that data is transmitted on the Internet
in the form of packets and that each packet has an intended recipient,
which is identified by an IP address.  But what mechanisms are in place
to ensure that a packet will get to its intended recipient?

<p>
The answer, in part, is the
<A HREF="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/router.htm/printable">router</A>.
A router is a device that links together two or more networks and
routes messages between them.

<!--
<p>
A good metaphor is to imagine that the Internet is like a large
system of roads and highways on which packets travel, 
where at each intersection a router acts as a "directions expert", 
telling each packet that arrives there which road is best to follow 
in order to get to its intended destination.
-->

<p>
Consider, once again, our postal service analogy.
As mail arrives at a post office, it is sorted into separate piles according
to where each piece of mail should go next.  In the Scranton post office,
there may be a pile of mail headed for Philadelphia (some of which will
later be routed to smaller post offices near Philadelphia and some of which
will be routed to Atlanta, perhaps, or Baltimore, or Chicago), another pile
headed for New York, another pile headed for Pittsburgh, and probably several
other piles headed for smaller post offices in surrounding towns such as
Dunmore, Moosic, Lake Ariel, etc., etc.
What determines into which pile a given piece of mail is placed?
The zip code of the destination address!
<p>
In other words, for each post office <em>A</em>, there exists some set of other
post offices
(say <em>{ B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, ..., B<sub>n</sub> }</em>)
to which <em>A</em> directly delivers pieces of mail (typically via truck).
For each piece of mail that arrives at <em>A</em>, the zip code in its
destination address is used to determine to which of those other
post offices (either <em>B<sub>1</sub></em> or <em>B<sub>2</sub></em>, etc.)
it should be taken next.
(Of course, if the zip code is within <em>A</em>'s local delivery area,
that piece of mail is routed, according to its street address, to the 
appropriate mail carrier who delivers mail within that local area. 

<p>
In a similar way, each router is connected directly to some set of other
routers (and possibly to a local network). 
As packets arrive at a router, it uses each packet's
destination IP address to determine to which of those other
routers to send it next (or whether the packet should be delivered to
a machine among those in the attached local network).
How does a router "know" to which router to send a given packet?
It maintains a <b>configuration table</b>, which, for each IP address,
indicates the proper router to which packets with that address should be sent.
Depending upon the sophistication of the router, the configuration
table could change as breakdowns or congestion occurs at various
places in the network.  (Of course, information regarding such
conditions would have to be gathered somehow by a router for it to
"know" that its configuration table should be modified.)

<p>
There is a wide variety of sophistication among routers.
Some simply have two lines, one corresponding to the local network
and the other to the Internet.  (This is analogous to a small post office
(e.g., one in Moosic) that sends all non-local mail to a larger one
(e.g., the one in Scranton).
Other routers have many lines and thus are more analogous to a 
larger post office (e.g., the one in Scranton) that sends mail 
directly to several other post offices.

<p>
The <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracert">tracert</A>
(standing for "trace route") command (which can be
invoked from a "Command Prompt" window under MS Windows XP) can be used
to "trace the route" taken by a message sent from your computer to the
computer at any specified IP address (or domain name, see below).
For example, a machine at google has the IP address 64.233.161.147;
if you were to enter the command
<p><center>
<tt>tracert 64.233.161.147</tt></center>

<p>
it would report the IP addresses of all the machines through which the
message was routed as it "hopped" along the path to google's machine.
(Technically, this isn't quite true, but it is close enough for our
purposes.)
<!-- Redundant:
(In the <tt>tracert</tt> command, one can also put a domain name (see below)
in place of the IP address.)
-->

<!--
<p>
Example on HowStuffWorks web pages: a company has a local area network
(LAN) that, because of heavy traffic, they split into two sub-networks
connected by a router.  (A typical LAN connects machines together using
Ethernet connections, which is analogous to having a bunch of neighbors
on a "party line".  As the number of households on the party line
grows (or how much they talk increases), it becomes increasingly
difficult to initiate a phone call.


<p>
Another function that some routers provide is in connecting
incompatible networks with one another.
-->

<H3>Domain Names</H3>
<p>
Chances are good that you refer to your friends at the U of Scranton
not by their Royal Numbers or SSN's, but rather by their names, which
tend to be much easier to remember.
Similarly, when referring to web sites on the Internet, we prefer to
use <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name">domain names</A>
rather than IP addresses.

<p>
Domain names have two or more parts, separated by periods.
Examples are <tt>www.cs.scranton.edu</tt>, <tt>google.com</tt>,
<tt>en.wikipedia.org</tt>, <tt>whitehouse.gov</tt>, and
<tt>www.st-andrews.ac.uk</tt>.  

<p>
As we move from right to left through a domain name, each part
provides more specific information.

<p>
The last (i.e., rightmost) part is called the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-level_domain">top-level domain</A>,
and it indicates one of a broad category of domains.
Common ones include
<ul>
  <li><b>com</b>: indicating a commercial enterprise</li>
  <li><b>org</b>: indicating a non-commercial organization</li>
  <li><b>edu</b>: indicating an educational institution</li>
  <li><b>net</b>: (at least sometimes) indicating an organization that
                  provides Internet access to customers
  </li>
  <li><b>gov</b>: indicating a government entity</li>
  <li><b>mil</b>: indicating a military entity</li>
</ul>
<!-- (For a more complete list, see Table 11.1, page 301, in Walker's book.)
-->
The names of many domains "located" outside the United States include a
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain">country
code top-level domain (ccTLD)</A>, such as <b>uk</b> (for United Kingdom),
<b>de</b> (for Germany (Deutschland)), or <b>cn</b> (for China).

<p>
Preceding (i.e., to the left of) the top-level domain is the
<b>second-level domain</b>, which is typically the name of the
company/organization/person to whom the domain name is registerd
(e.g., <tt>google</tt>).

<p>
The <b>third-level domain</b> (which precedes the second-level domain,
of course) either gives the name of a <b>subdomain</b> (such as <tt>cs</tt>
in <tt>cs.scranton.edu</tt>, which refers to the Computing Sciences
Department's local computer network within the larger U of Scranton
computer network) or it gives the name of a <b>host server</b>
(i.e., a computer that provides whatever services can be accessed there).
The traditional name for a web server is <tt>www</tt>, which explains
why so many domain names begin with that string.

<p>
The assignment of domain names to organizations, etc. (like that of
IP addresses) is managed by
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Corporation_for_Assigned_Names_and_Numbers">ICANN</A>.
The domain name <tt>scranton.edu</tt>, for example, is registered to the
University of Scranton, which means that it pays an annual fee to use
that name.  The name <tt>scranton.com</tt> (as of April 2008) is registered to
Domains by Proxy, Inc., which has a Scottsdale, AZ address.


<p>
One way to get a domain name registered to you is to request it 
from <A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com">Network Solutions</A>
<!-- (a <b>VeriSign</b> company) (at least indirectly).
-->
Some ISP's and web hosting companies offer this service, too.
To find out to whom, if anyone, a particular domain name is registered, go to   
<A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com/whois/index.jsp">Network
Solutions' WHOIS search page</A> and search for that name.

<p>
In specifying an e-mail address or a particular web page, we use domain names,
together with other information.
A typical e-mail address is a user ID followed by the
<tt>@</tt> symbol, followed by a domain name, as in
<p><center><tt>smithj@yahoo.com</tt></center>

<p>
A web page is identified by a 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator">
Uniform Resource Locator</A> (URL), which consists of a
<b>scheme</b> (usually <tt>http://</tt>), followed by a domain name that
identifies the host computer where the page is found,
followed by a so-called
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathname">path</A> 
that identifies the specific file (directly accessible to that host computer)
containing the desired web page. 
For example, the URL
<p><center>
<tt>http://www.cs.scranton.edu/~mccloske/courses/cil102/index_s11.html</tt>
</center>
<P>
refers to our course web page.
The scheme is <tt>http://</tt> (which means that the HTTP protocol is
to be used in the communication between the <b>client</b> (typically,
a web browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer) and the
<b>server</b>, which is the web server identified by the domain name,
<tt>www.cs.scranton.edu</tt>.  The path is what's left, which indicates
that the web page referred to is in the file <tt>index_s11.html</tt>
within the folder <tt>cil102</tt>, which is within the folder
<tt>courses</tt>, which is in the folder <tt>~mccloske</tt>.

<p>
If the path is incomplete, in the sense that the file name is not
indicated, by default it is understood to be <tt>index.html</tt>.
If the scheme is not indicated, by default it is understood to be
<tt>http://</tt>.

<H3>Domain Name Servers</H3>
<p>
Suppose that it's a Friday afternoon and you're dying to know how your
favorite player is doing in this week's tournament on the PGA Tour.
So you fire up your computer, start up a web browser
(such as Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), type
<tt>www.pgatour.com</tt> into its address bar, and then press the
ENTER key.  Within a few seconds, the "home" (or "welcome") 
web page at the PGA Tour's web site appears on your browser's window.
How did it get there?

<p>
What happened is that, when you pressed the ENTER key, your browser
(taking note of the URL you entered into its address bar)
sent a request to the PGA Tour's web server for its home/welcome web page.
And the PGA Tour's web server, upon receiving the request, complied.
Your computer, upon receiving that web page, fed it to the browser program,
which displayed that page.  A similar process occurs when you click on a
<A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink">hyperlink</A> on a web page.
For example, the hyperlink in the previous sentence is encoded in this
web page using HTML's <b>A</b> tag (for "anchor"): 
<p><center><tt>
&lt;A HREF="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink"&gt;hyperlink&lt;/A&gt;
</tt></center>
<p>
Notice that the code includes the URL of the web page that the browser
will request (from the web server that has it) when the user clicks on
the hyperlink.

<p>
But all this raises an important question:
If all data transmitted on the Internet is in the form
of packets, each of which includes a (numerical) IP address 
specifying its intended destination, and a web browser is provided
with only the URL of the web page requested by its user (either in
the form of a URL typed into the address bar or one specified in
the HTML code underlying a hyperlink), how does the browser
"figure out" to which IP address to send the request for the web page?
(Recall that a URL includes domain name information but nothing about
an IP address.)
Similarly, how does an e-mail program, given only the e-mail address
of the intended recipient but not the IP address of the e-mail
server that manages that recipient's e-mail, figure out to which
IP address to send the e-mail?

<p>
The answer is the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name_server">Domain Name System</A>
(DNS) and the
<A HREF="http://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm/printable">Domain Name
Servers</A> that implement it.
The basic function of these machines is to act as 
"directory assistance operators"
for translating domain names into IP addresses.  
(That is, the DNS system is analogous to a telephone directory, which,
as you know, maps names to telephone numbers.  Such a directory is
useful because it gives us the ability to obtain a person's 
telephone number if we know her name.)
<!--
(It is analogous to wanting to make a phone call to someone whose
name you know but whose phone number you do not know.  Before you
can make the call, you first must look up the number in a directory
that maps names to phone numbers.)
-->

<p>
For example, when the user tells a web browser to fetch a particular
web page (as described by a URL), either by entering the URL into
the browser's address bar or by clicking on a hyperlink specifying
that URL, the browser's first task is to obtain the IP address 
of the web server that has that web page.  The web server in question
is identified in the URL, of course, by the domain name (including 
the host name) within it.
Only after it obtains that IP address can it send a request 
(for the specified web page) to the host at that address.
To obtain that IP address, the browser sends a request to its
<b>default name server</b> (every domain is required to have a 
"local" name server such that it "knows" the IP addresses of all the 
machines in its own domain and vice versa) to translate the given 
domain name into an IP address.  If that name server lacks the
required information, it asks a "higher-level" name server for it 
(which may have to make a request to yet another name server,
and so on).  (The system is designed so that, unless something is
wrong, the required information will be found.) 

<p>
As an example of DNS, enter into a command prompt window
<p><center><tt>nslookup www.google.com</tt></center>

<p>
(or substitute any domain name in place of google).
The result is a list of IP addresses assigned to machines at that
site.


<!--
<p>
root name servers: if it doesn't know IP address, it knows the IP
address of a (2nd-level) name server that does, and gives you
that address.

<p>
Caching.

-->

<h3>Search Engines</h3>
    When you submit a query to a search engine (e.g., google), you
    typically get a response within a second or two.  How in the
    world can a search engine (which, of course, is just a program)
    not only search through the billions of pages on the WWW, but also
    "figure out" which of them are relevant to your query, in less than
    two seconds?
    </p><p>
    The answer is that a search engine does not search the entire WWW
    every time it receives a query.  Rather, it searches a (large)
    index that maps terms to the URLs of web pages in which the terms
    appear, much like the index in the back of a textbook maps terms
    to the page numbers of the pages in which they appear.  So if a
    user's query is "golf club", the first thing that a search engine
    will do is to use the index to find the URLs of every web page
    containing either of those two words.  (Any page that mentions
    neither term is unlikely to be relevant, after all.)
    </p><p>
    Of course, the contents of a (traditional) book doesn't change,
    and so its index need not be changed.  The WWW, on the other hand,
    is a dynamic repository, with new web pages appearing and old ones
    either changing or disappearing every day.  Hence, the index that
    a search engine uses must be kept up-to-date.  This is the job
    of software called <b>spiders</b> or <b>bots</b>, which, on a
    24/7 basis, do nothing but "crawl" the web, scanning every web
    page that they can find (by following links from pages that have
    been found already) and updating the index according to what they find.
    </p><p>
    Another important aspect of a search engine is its method of
    calculating <b>relevance</b>, which is a measure of how closely
    a web page "matches" a user's query (and thereby provides an
    estimate of the likelihood that the user would find that web page
    to contain useful information).
    When a search engine reports a "list of hits" to the user, it lists
    the pages in (what it "thinks" is) decreasing order of relevance.
    </p><p>
    How can a search engine make a "judgement" regarding the relevance
    of a web page?  Different search engines use different criteria
    (which are kept secret), but, first and foremost, it is based upon
    which words appear on a page, and the frequency with which they appear.
    So a page that mentions neither "golf" nor "club" is very unlikely to be
    judged to be relevant with respect to the "golf club" query.
    All other things being equal, a page containing both terms will be
    judged as being more relevant than a page that mentions only one of
    them, and a page that mentions "golf" fifty times will be ranked higher
    than one that mentions it only once.
    </p><p>
    Other criteria are also used, including <b>PageRank</b>
    (a trademark of Google), <b>click popularity</b>, <b>stickiness</b>,
    and <b>sponsorship</b>.  (These are described in the web textbook.)

<b>Computer Networks:</b> LAN's (local area) and WAN's (wide area).
Purpose is to allow computers to communicate with one another and to
share resources (e.g., printers, storage devices).
In order to keep costs reasonable, computers on a network must share a
common transmission "wire".  (Analogy to customers sharing a transport
mechanism (i.e., conveyor belt) in Service Merchandise stores.)

<p>
<b>Packet Switching:</b> All data transferred across the Internet
is in the form of <b>packets</b>.  The sending computer divides a
message/document into packets and sends each one separately.
The receiving computer reassambles the original message from 
the packets that arrive.
(A packet has an allowable maximum length.)
Computers "take turns" in sending/receiving messages.

<p>
Using packet switching prevents one machine from "hogging" the transmission
line when it wants to send/receive a large message.  (Analogy to Service
Merchandise store: one customer's large order should not hold up
everyone else's.)

<p>
Each packet is comprised of a <b>header</b>, which (in addition to other
info) identifies the sending and receiving computers (by IP address),
plus a body, which contains (a portion of) the message.

<p>
Packet switching nicely "scales up" as more computers are added to a
network.

<p>
<b>Internet: A network of networks:</b>
Thousands of LAN's and WAN's are "connected" to the Internet.
How is this done? (Especially considering that different networks tend
to be incompatible.)  The trick is to use <b>routers</b>, which are
computers whose only job is to "interconnect" two (or more) different
networks together.  A router's job is to rout packets to their intended
destinations.  A router is analogous to a post office!

<p>
<b>IP (Internet Protocol) Software:</b> IP specifies, in great detail,
the rules that computers must follow in order to communicate via the
Internet.  In particular, it specifies the format of each IP <em>datagram</em>
(i.e., packet).

<p>
IP gives the illusion that the Internet is one big network, rather
than a bunch of incompatible networks hooked together.

<p>
Every computer (on Internet) has a unique address (IP address).
The IP address is a 32-bit number.  By convention, we write it
as a sequence of four 8-bit numbers separated by periods, such as
134.198.14.5 .  Because each number is stored in 8 bits, the possible
range of values is 0 .. 255 (2 to the 8th power different possibilities).
 

<p>
<b>TCP</b>: Transmission Control Protocol: Helps to solve problems
that can occur in packet switching system.  E.g. a router receives
more datagrams than it can handle.

<p>
<b>Domain Name System (DNS):</b>
Consider what happens when you are viewing a Web page and you click
on a link.  This tells the browser to fetch another web page, whose
location (name of computer, plus file name, such as
<br>
<center>
www.cs.uofs.edu/~mccloske/index.html 
</center>
which refers to the
file named <em>index.html</em> within my home subdirectory on the
web server named <em>www.cs.uofs.edu</em>) is specified within the HTML
code that represents the current page.
But, in order to fetch the sought web page, the browser has to know the
IP address of the computer on which it is stored.  
The purpose of the DNS is to act as a directory (analogous to the telephone
directory) that allows the browser to "look up" a computer name and obtain
its IP address.  Once it "knows" the IP address of the machine holding
the sought web page, it can send a requrest to that machine asking for
said web page.
