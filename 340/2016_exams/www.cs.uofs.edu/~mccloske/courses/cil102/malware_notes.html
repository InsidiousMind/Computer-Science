<p>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware">Malware</A>
(which is a contraction for "malicious software") 
is "software designed to infiltrate or damage a computer
system without the owner's informed consent".
<p>
This covers a variety of hostile, intrusive, and/or annoying
categories of software that are commonly referred to as
<b>viruses</b>, <b>worms</b>, <b>trojan horses</b>, <b>rootkits</b>,
<b>spyware</b>, <b>adware</b>, and <b>ransomware</b>.

<p>
The earliest examples of malware (which go back to at least 1988 and the
infamous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Internet Worm</a>)
were simply experiments or pranks (some instigated by teenagers wanting to
prove themsleves to be computer "whizzes") that were meant to be, at worst,
annoying, rather than to cause any serious damage.

<p>
More recently, however, the typical motives for purveyors of malware 
are either purely malicious or to make (or steal) money. 

<p>
Among the destructive actions that malware can take is to 
delete or corrupt data that resides on a storage device
(e.g., hard disk).

<p>
Another use of malware is to turn a computer into a 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_computer">zombie</A>,
meaning one whose processing and/or storage capabilities are 
being used (surreptitiously) by an unauthorized party to perform 
unauthorized actions.  Examples of how zombies are used include
<ul>
  <li>sending <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_spam">e-mail
      spam</A> (see below)
  </li>
  <li>engaging in distributed
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">
      denial-of-service (DoS) attacks</a>: 
      such an attack is usually characterized by a large number of
      computers simultaneously sending messages to the same server in the
      hope of overwhelming its capacity to receive and respond to
      those messages (causing the server to "crash" and thereby
      denying its (legitimate) clients access to whatever services
      it provides).
  </li>
  <li>hosting (and serving) "contraband" data such as child pornography
      or copyrighted material (e.g., music)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The category of malware known as
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyware">spyware</A>
(also called <b>privacy-invasive software</b>) monitors the computer user,
keeping track of things such as which web sites the user visits or
even recording every keystroke the user makes, and possibly sending
(some of) this information back to the source.
<p>
<b>Why?</b>  So that the unscrupulous people behind the spyware can
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">mine the data</a>
to obtain credit card numbers or user id's and passwords 
that allow access to web sites where private information
(such as bank account records) could be found or where they could
commit theft.
Or, somewhat less malevolently, to collect data about the user's
preferences (in terms of consumer products) either for marketing
purposes or to make personalized pop-up advertisements appear as the
user is working.

<p>
<a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware_(malware)">Ransomware</a>
is a class of malware that restricts access to the computer that it
infects, demanding a ransom be paid in order for the restrictions
to be removed.

<p>
Viruses and worms are the best-known types of malware, and what
distinguishes them from the others is that they are able to
self-replicate.

<p>
A <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus">computer virus</A> 
is a small piece of (executable) software that gets "attached" to
("embedded within" is probably more accurate) another (typically,
legitimate) program.  (A program that has a virus embedded within it
is said to be <b>infected</b>.)
<p>
When an infected program is executed, the embedded virus (which itself
gets executed) searches for one or more other programs (typically on the
same storage device as the infected program) to infect, and does so.
In this way, each time an infected program is executed, the virus spreads
to one or more others (on the same computer system).
<p>
A virus can spread from one machine to another if an infected program
is downloaded from a web page or is e-mailed from one computer to another
(and later executed).
A clever way in which a virus can spread itself via e-mail
is to form an innocuous e-mail message that includes as an attachment
a copy of the virus itself (or some program infected with it) and then
to send that e-mail message to one or more of the e-mail addresses that
appears in the user's e-mail address book.  Any recipient who, while
reading her e-mail, allows the attachment to execute ends up with an
infected computer!
<p>
Indeed, this ploy was especially effective in spreading viruses
to machines running older Microsoft operating systems (e.g., Windows 95)
because the standard e-mail program would open an attachment
immediately rather than waiting for the user to do so explicitly
(by clicking on it).
If the attachment was an executable file containing a virus,
this would cause the machine to become infected.
This is a classic example of a <b>security hole</b>.)


<p>
If viruses did nothing other than to spread from program to program,
they would be doing little more harm than to waste storage space
and processing time.  But a virus usually also carries a <b>payload</b>,
which is executable code that performs some other (usually malicious,
or at least annoying) actions (such as deleting or corrupting data
on a storage device, or displaying some kind of goofy message on
the user's screen).  Often, a virus is designed so that its
payload lays dormant until some event <b>triggers</b> it.  
An example of a trigger is the arrival of a particular calendar date.
Or the trigger could be based upon how many times the virus had been
replicated, so that, for example, the 20th time it happens, the payload
would be executed.  If no trigger occurs for days or weeks after an
infection, and hence the virus causes no visible "symptoms" during that
period of time, it may be very difficult to determine its source.

<p>
A <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_worm">worm</A>
is much like a virus (indeed, for the purposes of this course
it is not essential that you really appreciate the distinction),
but it is more aggressive in terms of how it spreads: it actively
transmits itself over a network in order to infect other
computers on that network.  (It, too, typically carries a payload.)
It is able to spread by exploiting <b>security holes</b> that exist
in operating systems and/or programs.
<p>
The existence of such security holes explains
why it is a good idea to keep up-to-date with respect
to Microsoft's Windows Updates.  These updates are 
software <b>patches</b> that, at least in part, 
are for the purpose of plugging newly-discovered security holes.

<p>
A somewhat related topic is <b>spam</b>, which is unwanted e-mail,
typically either for the purposes of advertising
(e.g., penis-enlargement products have recently become all the rage) or 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</A>.
In phishing, you get an e-mail that, seemingly, is from some reputable
outfit, such as amazon.com, ebay, paypal, a bank, or a credit card
company.  It might tell you something to the effect that there have been
attempts to break into your account, and that, as a result, some of
your account's privileges have been suspended.  It asks you to click
on a link to get to the web site, where you can log in and straighten
things out.  But the web site to which the link takes you is phony
(even though it may look legitimate) and it asks you to enter your
user id and password (or credit card number).
By doing so, you will have given this valuable data to unscrupulous
people who may decide to use it to rip you off or "steal your identity".

<H3>How does your computer get infected?</H3>
<p>
Infection occurs when a program executes and literally infects one or more
of the programs already residing on the hard drive (or other storage device)
by attaching a virus to them.
From where would such a program come?  

<p>
Two common sources are e-mail attachments and web pages.
An e-mail attachment can be any kind of file, including one that
contains a program (i.e., executable code).  If it happens to be
an infected program, and it is executed, it could infect others.
Hence, be very wary about double-clicking on an e-mail attachment from
an untrusted source, especially if it is indicated that the attachment
is a file whose name ends with <tt>.exe</tt>, <tt>.com</tt>, or <tt>.vbs</tt>
(as these are common suffixes of files containing programs).  And keep
in mind that even "trusted sources" should not be trusted too highly,
for at least two reasons.  One is that an e-mail that says it's from
a particular source may actually be from someone else.  (This is
called <b>address spoofing</b>.)  Another reason is that, as explained
above, some viruses spread themselves by sending copies of themselves
via e-mail attachments in messages sent to addresses in the infected
computer's e-mail addressbook.  Hence, if your friend's computer gets
infected, the virus may send a copy of itself to you without your friend
having any idea that it happened (even though the e-mail's return
address is your friend's address).

<!--
E-mail programs that ran on older Microsoft operating systems
(e.g., Windows 95) would open an attachment immediately rather than
waiting for the user to do so explicitly.  If the attachment was an
executable file containing a virus, this would cause an infection to occur.)

Or in a MS Word document or Excel spreadsheet that has a <b>macro</b>
in it.  Or from a web site.  Story of Paul Jackowitz and the Scranton Prep
baseball photos page.

<p>
Similarly, if you are browsing a web page and a pop-up window appears,
be careful about clicking on any links/buttons there, as doing so may
result in your machine becoming infected.


<H3>What can you do to combat malware?</H3>
Be careful what you click on, as pointed out above!
Also, keep up-to-date 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software">anti-virus software</A>
running on your machine, as well as anti-spyware software.
(Some anti-virus software includes protection against spyware, too.)

<p>
Unfortunately, detecting viruses is difficult, and even the best 
anti-virus software cannot detect all viruses.  (In fact, it's
theoretically impossible to do so!)  It's important to keep anti-virus
software up-to-date because such software typically works, at least in part,
by scanning for known viruses, and new viruses appear often.

<p>
Another software tool for protecting yourself is the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall">firewall</A>,
which is a program that monitors and filters the flow of data 
between computer networks.
In the context of the user of a PC or laptop computer, the purpose of a 
firewall is to prevent Internet intruder from gaining access
to the user's data and programs.
