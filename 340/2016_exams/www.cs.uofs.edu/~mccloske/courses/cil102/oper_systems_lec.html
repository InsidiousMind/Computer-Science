How Operating Systems Work</A>


<!--
<p>
An operating system is (system) software that runs on a computer for the
purpose of "controlling the activities of the machine" and "managing the
machine's available resources";  this makes it possible for users to run
application programs.

What does an OS do?  Several things:

* shell: provides a user interface (e.g., GUI, command-line, etc.)
* Command Processor: accepts commands (keyboard presses, mouse clicks, etc.)
    and takes appropriate actions
* Scheduler :  invoked by the command processor, it puts a new process
    into the list of processes waiting to be executed.  But first it
    needs to use file manager in order to find the code
* File manager and resource allocator : controls retrieval/placement of data
      on disks, etc., allocation of printers, tapes, etc.
memory manager: where to put stuff in RAM
dispatcher: access to CPU. Processes are either blocked, ready, or
  executing.  Time slices.  Interrupts.


Evolution of OS's:
* Early days: Each programmer took over a machine for a period of time
   and controlled it "manually".
* Batch Processing: Computer operator was in control; programmers would
   submit "jobs" (pile of punch-hole cards), and they would be executed
   in possibly FIFO order.  (Input data had to be provided with program)
* Interactive Processing: addressed need for program user to provide
   input interactively. (dialog between user and computer)
* time-sharing: multiple users supported at same time.
     Gives appearance of being devoted to each user, but actually
     they are sharing resources.
* networks: multiple computers sharing resources.

Recall that a computer program is a set of instructions that can be
interpreted and executed by a computer. 
<em>Software</em> is a collective term for computer programs, although
it is also sometimes used to refer to stored data.
Software is commonly categorized as follows:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_software">Application
    Software</a> is intended to help a user to perform
    some task (or set of related tasks) of interest.
    </p><p>
    Examples of popular applications include document creation/editing
    (MS Word), presentation creation/editing (MS Powerpoint), 
    database management (MS Access, various Oracle products),
    accounting/financial management (Quickbooks),
    web browsing (Mozilla Firefox), (academic) course management (Angel),
    media players (for listening to music or watching videorecordings),
    and games.
    </p><p>
    Note that all of these tasks relate to activities (e.g., information
    creation/management/retrieval and entertainment) in which humans
    engaged long before computers existed, but for which computers have
    been found to be useful tools.  (That is, computers have been found
    to be <b>applicable</b> in carrying out these tasks.)
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_software">System
    Software</a>:
    <!-- is for the purpose of operating the computer hardware
    in order to provide a platform for executing application software.
    -->
    This refers to programs that either make the computer usable at all
    (e.g., the operating system) or provide utilities/tools by which to
    make the computer's operation more efficient or pleasant.
    One could distinguish between these sub-categories: 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">Operating
        System</a>: The purpose of an OS is to organize/control/manage a
         computer's hardware and software resources so as to make it possible
         for application programs to run, hence making the machine usable and
         useful.  
         <!-- Implementing the functions that an OS provides via software
          rather than "hardwiring" it into the electronic circuitry
          makes a computer more flexible in that 
         -->
      </li>
      </p><p>
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_software">Utility
        software</a>: Examples include programs for managing files on secondary
        storage (copying, moving (from one folder to another), deleting, and
        compressing/decompressing files; disk defragmentation),
        program installing/uninstalling;
        installing printers (or other hardware);
        setting time and date; setting up a local network;
        system configuration, and anti-virus programs.
        <p>
        More generally, a utility program is one whose purpose is to
        aid a user in making effective use of a computer (and/or
        to make the experience more pleasant).
      </li>
      </p><p>
      <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS">BIOS</a>
        (Basic Input/Output System): used when a computer is powered up;
        checks that various components are working and initiates loading
        into RAM of the operating system, to which control is then
        relinquished.
      </li>

In recent years, desktop and laptop PC's normally have come pre-loaded 
with the most recent incarnation of the <em>Microsoft Windows</em> family
of operating sytems, the latest of which is <em>Windows 7</em>.
<!-- Vista</em>, which became available in 2007. -->
However, many people still use one of its predecessors, either 
<em>Vista</em> or <em>Windows XP</em>.
Many corporate (and educational institution) computers
run some flavor of <em>Unix</em> (possibly <em>Linux</em>), which is also 
popular among serious computer enthusiasts, who tend to view Windows 
(and Microsoft products in general) with some disdain.
Apple Macintosh computers come pre-loaded with a flavor of Unix called
<em>OS X</em>.

<p>
Special-purpose computers, such as those that control microwave ovens,
have no need for an OS, because the set of functions they perform is narrow
and unchanging, and hence these functions are typically "hardwired" into the
electronic circuitry.  
Computational devices that are designed to be more flexible, on the other
hand, run under the direction of operating systems.  By "flexibile" we
mean that their behavior can be changed, either by upgrading (or adding new)
application programs or possibly even upgrading (or replacing) the OS itself.
<em>Cell phones</em> and <em>personal digital assistants</em> (PDAs)
utilize OS's (e.g., Android),
although they tend to be somewhat more rudimentary than the
OS's used on more powerful desktop/laptop computers.

<p>
<b>Question:</b> What does an operating system do?
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> At least two main things:
<ol>
  <li>It manages the hardware and software resources of the system, including
      the processor, memory, and disk space. (On a cell phone, this list
      would include the keypad, the screen, the address book,
      the phone dialer, the battery, and the network connection.)
  </li>
  <li>It provides a stable, consistent way for application programs (and
      users) to communicate with the hardware without having to know all
      the details of the hardware (such as which brand/model of hard disk
      or printer is attached).  
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
One can categorize OS's based upon the kinds of computers they control
and the kinds of applications they support.  Indeed, we can identify
four broad classes:
<ul>
  <li><b>real-time</b>: used for controlling machinery, scientific instruments,
      and industrial systems (e.g., factories, nuclear reactors).
      This kind of OS typcially provides very little user interface
      support or end-user utilities; rather, its purpose is to ensure
      that certain events happen (in whatever environment it controls)
      in the right sequence and at the right times.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>single-user, single-task</b>: designed to manage a computer so that
      one user can execute one program at a time.  The <em>Palm OS</em> 
      for Palm hand-held computers is an example, as was
      <em>MS-DOS</em> (Microsoft Disk Operating System), which ran on
      "IBM-compatible" PC's in the early 1980's. 
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>single-user, multi-tasking</b>: designed to allow a single user
      to run multiple programs at the same time.  MS Windows is an example,
      This is more complicated than single-tasking because the various
      executing processes must not be allowed to interfere with each
      other (for example, by overwriting each other's data in RAM) and each
      process must be given sufficiently many "processor cycles" (with
      sufficient frequency) to continue doing its job.  (If a media player
      program is playing a music CD or a video on DVD, the processor
      must devote some attention to it on a regular basis or else the
      sound or image will become "choppy".)
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>multi-user</b>: designed to allow multiple users to run
      multiple programs at the same time.  This is more complicated
      than single-user because care must be taken not to allow one
      user's program to access another user's private data.
      Examples include any in the <em>Unix</em> family of OS's,
      including Linux.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Now we answer, in somewhat more detail, the question raised earlier:
<em>What does an operating system do?</em>
We can identify at least six categories of tasks:
<ul>
  <li><b>processor management</b>: schedules processes for execution.
      Typically, many processes are "in execution" concurrently, but the
      CPU can be devoted to running (i.e., executing the instructions of)
      at most one process at any moment in time.
      (Under Windows XP, press CNTRL-ALT-DEL (at the same time) in order
      to get the Windows Task Manager, which lists all the processes
      running, how much RAM they're occupying, and what percentage of
      CPU time they are consuming.) 
      Each process takes turns getting "time slices"
      (on the order of thousandths of a second) during 
      which the CPU executes some of its instructions before switching
      its attention to another process.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>memory management</b>: decides where in RAM to store programs and
      data currently in use (making sure not to allow one to overwrite
      another).
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>device management</b>: handles input from the keyboard and 
     mouse, makes sure that print jobs are scheduled properly.
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>storage management</b>: maintains records about the files resident
      on secondary storage devices (e.g., hard disk, memory sticks),
      keeping track of where each file is stored and where "empty" space
      exists for storing new files.
      (Such records are stored on the storage devices themselves,
      of course.)
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>application interface</b>: an operating system acts as a layer
      between the hardware and application programs, allowing the latter
      to issue commands and requests to the former without the latter
      having to "know" all the details of how the former works.
      A good analogy is the "interface" through which one drives an
      automobile.  Over the past fifty years, many advances have been made
      in the "hardware" at the core of an automobile: the engine,
      transmission, braking system.  Yet the interface that a driver
      utilizes has changed very little over those years: it consists mainly
      of gas and brake pedals, a steering wheel, and a lever for changing
      gears.  
  </li>
  </p><p>
  <li><b>user interface</b>: similar to the item above, except this
      allows a user (rather than an application program) to interact
      with the hardware in a structured, consistent way.  
  </li>
</ul>
