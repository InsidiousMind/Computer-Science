Description of (and examples pertaining to) a hypothetical computer
</H3>

</p><p>
<b>Acknowledgement:</b>
The "machine" described here is an adaptation of that presented in 
<em>Introducing Computer Concepts by Simulating a Simple Computer</em>,
by Dr. Robert A. Campbell, SIGCSE Bulletin, Vol. 28, No. 3, Sept. 1996,
pp. 9-11.  

</p><p>
The purpose of this presentation is to illustrate how an
electronic digital computer operates at the machine language level
of abstraction.  The electronic aspects of its operation are not treated.

</p><p>
The hypothetical computer described here serves as a model, or abstraction,
of the step-by-step behavior of a real-life digital computer.
Being only a model (and thus a simplification of reality),
the hypothetical computer does not possess all the capabilities of a
(typical) real-life general-purpose computer; however, it operates
in, essentially, the same way.
<!-- in a manner that is, essentially, the same as 
     a real-life digital computer.
-->
Thus, by coming to an understanding of this model, you will have come also
to a better understanding of what goes on "under the hood" of your
<!-- desktop PC or any other digital computer that you happen to use. -->
laptop computer, or smart phone, or other digital data processing device
that you may happen to use.


<h4>Components of the hypothetical computer:</h4>

<ol>
  <li><b>RAM (main/primary memory/storage):</b>
      Comprised of 4096 (that's 2<sup>12</sup>) 16-bit memory locations
      (or "words") with addresses 0, 1, 2, ..., 4095.
      (A memory location is analogous to a mailbox in a post office or
      to a cell in an MS-Excel worksheet.)
  </li>
  <li><b>Central Processing Unit (CPU):</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Control unit (CU):</b>
              does the decoding (or interpreting) of instructions, and sends
              out the electronic signals that cause an instruction to be
              executed
      </li>
      <li><b>Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU):</b>
              carries out the arithmetic calculations (e.g., adding) and
              logical calculations (e.g., comparing)
      </li>
      <li><b>Registers:</b>
          special, high-speed storage cells (but not part of RAM) that are
          directly accessible by the CU and ALU
         <ol>    
           <li><b>Accumulator (ACC)</b>  (16 bits)
               (typically) holds data that has just been produced as the
                result of an instruction or that is about to be operated upon
           </li>
           <li><b>Instruction Counter (IC):</b>  (12 bits)
               holds the address of the memory location containing the 
               next instruction to be executed.  In effect, the IC is
               the computer's way of "remembering where it is" within
               the program being executed.  (You should be able to make
               the connection between the size of this register, 12 bits,
               and the # of distinct addresses in RAM, 2<sup>12</sup>.)
               Perhaps a better name for this register would be
               Instruction <em>Pointer</em>, as its purpose is to hold
               a value that "points to" the memory cell containing the
               next instruction.
           </li>
           <li><b>Instruction Register (IR)</b>  (16 bits)
               holds the instruction about to be (or being) executed
           </li>
         </ol>    
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>I/O Devices:</b>
     <ul>
        <li>keyboard, at which the user can enter integer values</li>
        <li>screen, on which integer values can be displayed</li>
     </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
General-purpose digital computers are designed to employ the
<em>stored program</em> concept, which is to say that not only data 
occupies memory, but also the instructions comprising the software that
is processing that data.  Another way to look at it is that instructions
are nothing but another form of data, in addition to numbers, characters,
images, etc.

</p><p>
Recall from the <em>Giant Brains</em> videorecording that one interesting
weakness of ENIAC was that it was NOT a stored-program computer.
That is, a program being executed on the ENIAC was embodied/expressed
in terms of its wiring, as opposed to being expressed as a sequence of
instructions (encoded by bit strings or characters, or whatever) stored
in its memory.
As a consequence of this, changing ENIAC's programming required that
technicians make physical alterations to its wiring, which could take 
hours or even days!!

</p><p>
Let us assume that we have some way of filling each memory location with a
string of 16 bits.  (This allows us to place a program that we wish to be
executed, as well as data that might be useful to it, into RAM.)  Once we
hit the EXECUTE button on the computer, it repeats, over and over, the
following <em>fetch-decode-execute</em> cycle, stopping only after the HALT
instruction has been executed.


<h4>Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle:</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Fetch next instruction
        (i.e., copy into the IR the contents of the
        memory location identified by the IC)
  </li>
  <li>Increment the IC (i.e., add one to the value in IC)
  </li>
  <li>Execute the instruction occupying the IR
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p> 
The purpose of (2) is to make it so that, by default, the instructions will
be executed in the same order as they appear in memory.  (This is analogous
to following a recipe line by line.)  Only by executing an instruction that
modifies the contents of the IC can this behavior be changed.  In order to
design programs with loops (instruction sequences that are repeated during
execution of a program) we need instructions that do exactly this.

</p><p>
For convenience, we assume that, upon hitting the EXECUTE button, the IC is
initialized to zero.  This means that the first instruction executed will
always be the one stored in location 0.  (For this reason, we will always
assume that the program we want to run is stored beginning at location
0 in RAM.  Exactly how we get our program there is beyond the scope of this
discussion.)


<h4>Encoding of instructions</h4>

<p>
An instruction is encoded inside a 16-bit word as follows:

<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>                     |
         +--+--+--+--|--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
         |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
         +--+--+--+--|--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
          operation  |            operand
            code      
        (1st 4 bits)           (last 12 bits) </pre> 
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

Thus, when decoding the contents of the IR, the control unit will interpret
the first four bits as identifying <b>which kind</b> of instruction is to be 
executed and the last 12 bits as the <b>operand</b> (i.e., the data to be used
by the instruction).  Note that some kinds of instructions do not use an
operand, in which case the last twelve bits are ignored.

<h4>Instruction Set/Repertoire</h4>

The hypothetical computer has a (small) repertoire of instructions that it is
capable of carrying out.   This is called its "instruction set", and it is as
follows:
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>
 Opcode       Name          Effect
 ---------    --------      -----------------------------------------
  0 (0000)    HALT          execution of program terminates
  1 (0001)    READ          copies data entered by user into ACC
  2 (0010)    WRITE         displays contents of ACC onto screen
  3 (0011)    LOAD          copies contents of specified location into ACC
  4 (0100)    LOAD-IM       copies specified data into ACC
  5 (0101)    STORE         copies contents of ACC into specified location
  6 (0110)    ADD           adds contents of specified location to ACC
  7 (0111)    ADD-IM        adds specified value to ACC
  8 (1000)    SUB           subtracts contents of specified location from ACC
  9 (1001)    SUB-IM        subtracts specified value from ACC
 10 (1010)    BRANCH        changes contents of IC to specified value
 11 (1011)    BRANCH-P      if ACC has positive value (i.e., greater than
                            zero), changes contents of IC to specified value
 12 (1100)    BRANCH-N      if ACC has negative value (i.e., less than zero),
                            changes contents of IC to specified value
 13 (1101)    BRANCH-Z      if ACC has value zero, changes contents of IC to
                            specified value
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
For example, a word of memory containing
</p><p>
<center>
<table>
<tr><td>
<pre>
    +--+--+--+--|--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+
    | 0| 0| 1| 1| 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 0| 1| 0| 1| 0| 1| 1|
    +--+--+--+--|--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+--+ </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>
corresponds to the instruction LOAD 43.  The first four bits contain the
operation code for LOAD (0011) and the last twelve bits contain (the binary
representation of) 43 (000000101011).
For the sake of convenience, henceforth we will not concern ourselves with
the details of the bit strings occupying the memory locations.

<p>
Examples of instructions (and the effect of executing each one):
<pre>
    LOAD 43:     copies contents of memory location 43 into ACC
    LOAD-IM 43:  places the (bit string corresponding to) value 43 into ACC
    STORE 12:    copies value in ACC into memory location 12
    ADD 17:      adds the value in memory location 17 to the value in ACC 
    BRANCH-Z 7:  examines ACC---if value there is zero, the contents of
                 the IC are changed to 7; otherwise, nothing happens
</pre> 


<h4>Example program 1: Finding sum of two inputs</h4>

<p>
Here is a program to accept two inputs from the user and display their sum.
(The contents of each memory location is given in "reader-friendly" form,
rather than in the form of a bit string.)
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>
   Mem
   Loc     Content         Remarks
   ---     ----------      ------------------------------------------
    0      READ            --reads 1st input (into ACC)
    1      STORE 6         --stores into location 6 (for safe keeping)
    2      READ            --reads 2nd input (into ACC)
    3      ADD 6           --adds 1st input to 2nd
    4      WRITE           --displays sum
    5      HALT            --execution terminates
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
In order to illustrate what happens during execution of the program, we
show a "snapshot" of the computer's state (which is given by the values in
each of its relevant memory locations) at the beginning and end of each
iteration of the fetch-decode-execute cycle.  In this particular example,
we assume that the user supplies inputs 31 and 14.  Each remark indicates
what actions occur during the corresponding iteration of the cycle.
(The change-of-state resulting from such actions can be discerned by
examining the contents of IC, ACC, etc. indicated on the next line.)

<h4>Example program 2: Countdown</h4>

<p>
Here is a program that accepts one input from the user and then displays
a countdown to zero, beginning with the input value.
This program illustrates the concept of a loop, which is a sequence of
instructions that gets executed repeatedly.  

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">

<pre>
   Mem
   Loc     Content          Remarks
   ---     ----------       --------------------------------------------
    0      READ             reads input into ACC
    1      BRANCH-N 5       if ACC's value is negative, go to location 5
    2      WRITE            outputs ACC's value
    3      SUB-IM 1         subtracts 1 from value in ACC
    4      BRANCH 1         go back to location 1
    5      HALT             terminate execution </pre>

Here is a history of the computation that would result if the user were
to enter 2 as the input value:

<h4>Exercise</h4>
</p><p>
Making use of pieces of the two programs presented above, develop a program
that, given as inputs two natural numbers (i.e., nonnegative integers),
outputs their product.

</p><p>
<b>Hint:</b> The product <tt>m&times;n</tt> is just the sum
<tt>n + n + ... + n</tt>, in which <tt>n</tt> appears <tt>m</tt> times.
A program that does this calculation can place zero into a particular
memory location and then add <tt>n</tt> to the value in that location
<tt>m</tt> times.  To make the code segment that does the adding repeat
exactly <tt>m</tt> times, the program can do a countdown, as in the
second example program above.
