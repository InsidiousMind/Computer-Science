Development of a program to compute Fibonacci numbers
</H3>

<p>
The Fibonacci function is often defined as follows:
<p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0">
<tr><td>f.0 = 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>f.1 = 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>f.k = f.(k-2) + f.(k-1) &nbsp; (for k&gt;1)</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Viewing this function as defining the sequence
</p><p>
<center>&lt; f.0, f.1, f.2, f.3, ... &gt;</center>
</p><p>
gives rise to the so-called Fibonacci sequence
</p><p>
<center>&lt; 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... &gt;</center>
<p>
in which, beginning at the third element, each element is the sum of
the preceding two.

<p>
Let's develop a program that, given as input a positive integer N,
calculates f.N.  Here is a specification:

<pre><code>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m : int;

     compute_f.N

     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

<p>
It seems likely that we will need to use repetition to solve this problem.
Applying the <em>replace a constant by a variable</em> heuristic, we can
rewrite the postcondition <em>Q</em> as the slightly stronger
<!--  <em>Q'</em>: -->
<p>
<center><tt>Q' : m = f.n  &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; n = N</tt></center>

<p>
Applying the <em>remove a conjunct</em> heuristic, we take the first
conjunct of <tt>Q'</tt> as a loop invariant and the second as the
negation of the loop's guard.  We obtain the following refinement of the 
specification:

<pre><code>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m : int;
     var n : int;

     n, m := ?, ?;
     { I : m = f.n }
     do n != N  &xrarr;  n, m := ?, ?;
     od
     { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; n = N }
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

<p>
First we consider how to initialize <code>n</code> and <code>m</code> so as
to "truthify" the proposed loop invariant.  That is, we wish to find
expressions to replace the question marks so that the Hoare Triple
<p>
<center><code>{ true } n,m := ?,? {I}</code></center>
<p>
holds.  (The post-condition of initialization is the loop invariant;
the pre-condition of this program is <em>true</em>.  Technically, the
condition N &gt; 0 is a pre-condition, but because it involves
only constants we view it as a "global invariant".)
The obvious possibilities for initialization
are <code>n,m := 0,0</code> (reflecting the fact that f.0 = 0)
and <code>n,m := 1,1</code> (reflecting the fact that f.1 = 1).
We choose the latter for reasons that will become clear later.

<p>
Either way, this suggests that <code>n</code> should be increased within
the body of the loop so as to eventually reach value <code>N</code>.
The simplest way to do that is by incrementing <code>n</code>, so that's
what we propose.  These refinements lead to the program
<pre>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m : int;
     var n : int;

     n,m := 1,1;
     { I : m = f.n }
     do n != N  --->  n,m := n+1,?;
     od
     { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = N }
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

<p>
It remains to determine how to update <code>m</code> inside the body of
the loop.  We attempt to calculate the appropriate expression <code>E</code>
by proving item <em>(ii)</em> among the five proof obligations for a loop:

<pre>
<em>(ii)</em> {I &and; B} n,m := n+1,E {I}

Assume I and B.

     wp.(n,m := n+1,E).I

  =    < wp assignment law >

     I(n,m := n+1,E)

  =    < defn of I; textual sub. >

     E = f.(n+1)
</pre>

At this point, our only manipulative opportunity arises from the third
equation in the definition of <em>f</em>.  However, for that equation
to apply requires that <code>n+1&gt;1</code>, i.e., <code>n&gt;0</code>.
As we initialized <code>n</code> to 1 and thereafter all changes to
<code>n</code> are due to incrementing it, it is clear that 
<code>n&gt;0</code> will be true.
(<b>Note:</b> This explains why we initialized <code>n</code> to 1 rather
than to 0!  <b>End of note.</b>)
Hence, we incorporate this condition
into the loop invariant so that we can use it here as an assumption.
Starting the proof over again with the stronger version of <code>I</code>
(namely, <code>I = I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub></code>, where
<code>I<sub>0</sub> : m = f.n</code> and <code>I<sub>1</sub> : n &gt; 0</code>),
we get

<p>
<em>(ii)</em> <code>{I &and; B} n,m := n+1,E {I}</code>

<pre>
Assume I (i.e., m = f.n and n &gt; 0) and B.

     wp.(n,m := n+1,E).I

  =    < wp assignment law >

     I(n,m := n+1,E)

  =    < defn of I; textual sub. >

     E = f.(n+1) &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; n+1 &gt; 0

  =    < assumption n &gt; 0 implies 2nd conjunct; (Gries 3.39) >

     E = f.(n+1)

  =    < assumption n &gt; 0 implies n+1 &gt; 1,
         justifying use of 3rd equation in defn of f >

     E = f.(n-1) + f.n

  =    < assumption m = f.n >

     E = f.(n-1) + m
</pre>

At this point, we observe that it would be nice to have a program variable,
say <tt>r</tt>, guaranteed to have value f.(n-1) at this point in
execution, because then we could finish the derivation of E:

<pre><code>
  =    < assumption r = f.(n-1) >

     E = r + m
</code></pre>
 
As we are free to introduce such a variable, we do so!  That is, we
<em>strengthen the loop invariant</em> by adding
<code>I<sub>2</sub> : r = f.(n-1)</code> as a new conjunct.
Of course, doing this brings with it the responsibility to introduce
code to initialize <code>r</code> so as to truthify <code>I<sub>2</sub></code>
and to update <code>r</code> during each loop iteration so as to preserve
the truth of <code>I<sub>2</sub></code>.  The refined program is as follows:

<pre>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m, r : int;
     var n : int;

     n, m, r := 1, 1, ?;
     { I : I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>, where
       I<sub>0</sub> : m = f.n, I<sub>1</sub> : n &gt; 0, and I<sub>2</sub> : r = f.(n-1) }
     do n != N  --->  n, m, r := n+1, r+m, ?;
     od
     { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = N }
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</pre>


Let's calculate the proper initialization to <tt>r</tt>, by deriving an
expression <code>F</code> satisfying <code>{true} n,m,r := 1,1,F {I}</code>.

<p>
By the Hoare Triple Assignment Law (and (Gries 3.73)),
this is equivalent to <code>[I(n,m,r := 1,1,F)]</code>.

<pre>
     I(n,m,r := 1,1,F)

  =    < defn of I; text. sub. >

     1 = f.1  &and;  1 > 0  &and;  F = f.(1-1)

  =    < defn of f; arithmetic, (Gries 3.39) >

     F = f.0

  =    < defn of f >

     F = 0 
</pre>

Next we determine how to modify <code>r</code> during each iteration.
As our previous work has demonstrated that execution of the loop body
preserves the truth of <code>I<sub>0</sub></code> and
<code>I<sub>1</sub></code> (neither of which mention <code>r</code>),
we use as a postcondition only <code>I<sub>2</sub></code>. 
<pre><code>
     {I &and; B} n,m,r := n+1, r+m, G {I<sub>2</sub>}

Assume I and B.

     wp.(n,m,r := n+1,r+m,G).I<sub>2</sub>

  =    < defn of I<sub>2</sub>; text. sub >

     G = f.(n+1-1)

  =    < arithmetic >

     G = f.n

  =    < assumption m = f.n >

     G = m
</code></pre>

We obtain the following program:

<pre><code>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m, r : int;
     var n : int;

     n,m,r := 1,1,0;
     { I : I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>, where I<sub>0</sub> : m = f.n, I<sub>1</sub> : n &gt; 0, and I<sub>2</sub> : r = f.(n-1) }
     do n != N  &xrarr;  n, m, r := n+1, r+m, m;
     od
     { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = N }
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

All that remains is to provide a bound function.  Here, the obvious
choice is <code>t : N-n</code>.  Technically, in order to prove item
<em>(iv)</em>, we need to include the condition <code>n&le;N</code>
within the loop invariant.  (We can incorporate this into
<code>I<sub>1</sub></code>.) Clearly, this condition is truthified
by initializing <code>n</code> to 1 (given that <code>N&gt;0</code> is
a global invariant) and preserved by incrementing <code>n</code> when
it is known that <code>n&lt;N</code>, as is guaranteed by 
<code>I &and; B</code>.
<p>
Here is the final, annotated program:

<pre><code>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m, r : int;
     var n : int;

     n,m,r := 1,1,0;
     { I : I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>, where I<sub>0</sub> : m = f.n, I<sub>1</sub> : 0&lt;n&le;N, and I<sub>2</sub> : r = f.(n-1) }
     { t : N-n }
     do n != N  &xrarr;  n, m, r := n+1, r+m, m;
     od
     { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = N }
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

</p><p>
Given the roles played by variables <tt>m</tt> and <tt>r</tt>, one could
make a reasonable argument that <tt>fibThis</tt> and <tt>fibPrev</tt>,
respectively, would be better names. 

</p><p>
Suppose that the precondition had been the weaker <code>N&ge;0</code>
rather than <code>N&gt;0</code>.  Since the program we developed above
works for any <code>N</code> strictly greater than zero, all we need to
do is to introduce a selection command, one branch of which handles the
case <code>N=0</code> and the other of which handles the case
<code>N&gt;0</code>.  Of course, the body of the latter branch would be
the loop (preceded by initialization code) that we developed above.
The body of the former branch would simply set <code>m</code> to zero,
as f.0 = 0.  Here is that program:

<pre><code>
  |[ con N : int;  { N &gt; 0 }
     var m, r : int;
     var n : int;

     if N = 0 &xrarr; m := 0;
     [] N > 0 &xrarr; 
        { N > 0 }
        n,m,r := 1,1,0;
        { I : I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>, where I<sub>0</sub> : m = f.n, I<sub>1</sub> : 0&lt;n&le;N, and I<sub>2</sub> : r = f.(n-1) }
        { t : N-n }
        do n != N  &xrarr;  n, m, r := n+1, r+m, m;
        od
        { Q' : m = f.n &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = N }
     fi
     { Q : m = f.N }
  ]|
</code></pre>

</p><p>
But this solution lacks some of the elegance of the original.
Can we somehow avoid having to introduce the selection command in order
to handle the case <code>N = 0</code>?
It turns out that we can!  
The only place where our reasoning relies upon <tt>n&gt;0</tt> is in the 
proof of loop checklist item <em>(ii)</em>, as there we made use of the 
fact that, by definition, n&gt;0 implies f.(n+1) = f.(n-1) + f.n.
(But this equation fails to hold for n = 0, because 
f.(-1) is not even defined.)

</p><p>
But there is no reason why we cannot modify the definition of f()
to enlarge its domain, as long as we change nothing else about the function.
So what we seek is a value for f.(-1) that is consistent with
f.1 = f.(-1) + f.0 (the recursive case of the function instantiated
with k=1).  But this works out to f.(-1) = f.1 - f.0 = 1 - 0 = 1.

</p><p>
All we have to change to make our original solution work is to make
the loop initialization code be
</p><p><center><code>n,m,r := 0,0,1;</code></center>

</p><p>
The loop invariant is weakened insofar as <code>I<sub>2</sub></code> becomes
<p><center><code>I<sub>2</sub> : 0&le;n&le;N</code></center>

</p><p>
Another generalization that could be made is to define
f.0 = A and f.1 = B, where A and B are "input constants".  
(Thus our domain-enlarged function has f.(-1) = B-A.) 
Then all we have to change in the program is to make the 
initialization assignment be

</p><p><center><code>n,m,r := 0,A,B-A;</code></center>
