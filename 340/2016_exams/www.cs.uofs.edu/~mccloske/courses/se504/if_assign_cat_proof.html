SE 504 <br />
Proof of correctness of a program composed of a selection (if) command
and an assignment
</h2>

<p>
<b>Note:</b> Here we use the notation <b>b.i</b> (as does Kaldewaij)
rather than the more familiar <b>b[i]</b> to refer to the i-th element
of array b.

</p><p>
Prove the following Hoare triple:
<pre>
{ P: 0&lt;i &and; i&lt;m &and; m&lt;N &and; (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m) }
if b.i >= b.m  -->  skip
[] b.i <= b.m  -->  m := i
fi
;i := i-1
{ Q: 0&le;i &and; i&lt;m &and; m&lt;N &and; (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m) }
</pre>

</p><p>
Note that <tt>P</tt> and <tt>Q</tt> differ only in that <tt>Q</tt>
allows <tt>i</tt> to have value zero.

</p><p>
<b>Solution:</b> <br />

The given Hoare triple is of the form 
<tt>{P} S<sub>1</sub>; S<sub>2</sub> {Q}</tt>,
where <tt>S<sub>1</sub></tt> is a selection command and
<tt>S<sub>2</sub></tt> is an assignment command.  The <b>Hoare triple
catenation law</b> tells us that, to prove it, it suffices to devise a
predicate <tt>R</tt> and to show
</p><p><center><tt>{P} S<sub>1</sub> {R}  &and;  {R} S<sub>2</sub> {Q}
</tt></center>

</p><p>
Because <tt>S<sub>2</sub></tt> is an assignment, we choose <tt>R</tt> to be
<tt>wp.S2.Q</tt>.  By definition of <tt>wp</tt>, this choice for <tt>R</tt>
truthifies <tt>{R} S<sub>2</sub> {Q}</tt>.  Hence, it remains only to
prove <tt>{P} S<sub>1</sub> {R}</tt>.  As <tt>S<sub>1</sub></tt> 
is a selection (i.e., if) command, we do so by applying the
<b>Hoare triple selection law</b>, which says that it suffices to show 
<ol type=a>
  <li><tt>[P &rArr; BB]</tt>, where <tt>BB</tt> is the disjunction of the
      guards, and
  </li>
  <li><tt>{P &and; B<sub>i</sub>} S<sub>i</sub> {R}</tt> (for all i).
  </li>
</ol>

</p><p>
As for (a), it is trivial, because, in any state, at least one of 
<tt>b.i &ge; b.m</tt> (i.e., <tt>B<sub>0</sub></tt>) or 
<tt>b.i &le; b.m</tt> (i.e., <tt>B<sub>1</sub></tt>) must hold.
If we insist on formality, we could prove (a) as follows.
(Notice that we don't even need to make use of <tt>P</tt> as an assumption.)

<pre>
     BB

 =      < BB is disjunction of guards, of which there are two >

     B<sub>0</sub> &or; B<sub>1</sub>

 =      < defn of B<sub>0</sub> and B<sub>1</sub> >

     b.i &ge; b.m  &or;  b.i &le; b.m

 =      < defn of &ge; >

     b.i = b.m  &or;  b.i > b.m  &or;   b.i &le; b.m

 =      < theorem: [&not;(x > y)  =  x &le; y] >

     b.i = b.m  &or;  b.i > b.m  &or;  &not;(b.i > b.m)

 =      < Excluded Middle (3.28); true is zero of &or; (3.29) >

     true
</pre>

</p><p>
As for (b), because there are two guarded commands in our selection command,
we are to prove both
<b>(i)</b> <tt>{P &and; B<sub>0</sub>} S<sub>0</sub> {R}</tt> and 
<b>(ii)</b> <tt>{P &and; B<sub>1</sub>} S<sub>1</sub> {R}</tt>.  Our
choice for R was <tt>wp.(i:=i-1).Q</tt>, which, applying the 
<b>wp assignment law</b> and textual substitution, works out to

</p><p><center><tt>
      R: 0&le;i-1 &and; i-1&lt;m &and; m&lt;N &and; (&forall;j | i-1 < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)
</tt></center>

</p><p>
<b>(i)</b> <tt>{P &and; B<sub>0</sub>} S<sub>0</sub> {R}</tt> 
 &nbsp; (i.e., <tt>[P &and; B<sub>0</sub> &rArr; wp.S<sub>0</sub>.R]</tt>)

</p><p>
We prove it by assuming the antecedant (<tt>P &and; B<sub>0</sub></tt>) and
showing the consequent (<tt>wp.S<sub>0</sub>.R</tt>).

<pre>
       wp.S<sub>0</sub>.R

       true  &and;  i-1&lt;m  &and;  m&lt;N  &and;  (&forall;j | i-1 < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

       true  &and;  true  &and;  i&lt;N  &and;  (&forall;j | i-1 < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

       true  &and;  true  &and;  true  &and;  (&forall;j | i-1 < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

   =      < true is identity of &and; (3.39), three times >

       (&forall;j | i-1 < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

   =      < split off term (8.23) (justified by fact that the assumptions
            guarantee i&lt;N, as noted above, from which it follows that
            there is at least one value of j satisfying i-1 < j < N 
           (i.e., the range is nonempty))                                  >

       b.i &ge; b.m  &and;  (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

   =      < assumption B<sub>0</sub>, (3.39) >

       (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)

   =      < (4th conjunct of) assumption P >

       true

<b>(ii)</b>
<tt>{P &and; B<sub>1</sub>} S<sub>1</sub> {R}</tt>
&nbsp; (i.e., <tt>[P &and; B<sub>1</sub> &rArr; wp.S<sub>1</sub>.R]</tt>)

</p><p>
We prove it by assuming the antecedant (<tt>P &and; B<sub>1</sub></tt>)
and showing the consequent (<tt>wp.S<sub>1</sub>.R</tt>).

       (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.i)
</pre>

Now what?  The expression above, which we want to prove, says that
<tt>b.j &ge; b.i</tt> for all j in the range <tt>i+1..N-1</tt>.
But this follows from the transitivity of &ge; together with two of our
assumptions, namely <tt>B<sub>1</sub></tt> 
(which says that <tt>b.m &ge; b.i</tt>)
and the 4th conjunct of <tt>P</tt> (which says that <tt>b.j &ge; b.m</tt> 
for all j in <tt>i+1..N-1</tt>).  How can we show this formally?
It is a bit tricky.  Here goes:
<pre>
  <==     < Body weakening/strengthening (9.11) >

       (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m  &and;  b.m &ge; b.i  &and;  b.j &ge; b.i)

   =      < by transitivity of &ge;, the 3rd conjunct in body of
            above is implied by the conjunction of the first two;
            thus, by (3.60), an equivalent expression is obtained
            by removing the 3rd conjunct                           >

       (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m  &and;  b.m &ge; b.i)

    =     < Distributivity of &and; over &forall; (9.7) >

       (&forall;j | i < j < N : b.j &ge; b.m)  &and;  b.m &ge; b.i

    =     < (4th conjunct of) assumption P and assumption B<sub>1</sub> >

       true &and; true

    =     < (3.40) >

       true 
</pre>

</p><p>
Summarizing, what we have shown is
</p><p><center><tt>
       [(P &and; B<sub>1</sub>)  &rArr;  (true &rArr; wp.S<sub>1</sub>.R)]
</tt></center>

</p><p>
But by (3.73), the consequent of the above is simply 
<tt>wp.S<sub>1</sub>.R</tt>.
Hence, we have proved 
<tt>[(P &and; B<sub>1</sub>)  &rArr;  wp.S<sub>1</sub>.R]</tt>,
as required.
