  Development of a program to solve the Maximum Segment Sum Problem
</h2>

<p>
Let A be an integer array.  Define, for p and q satisfying 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A,
<p><center>
                 S.p.q = (+i | p&le;i&lt;q : A.i)
</center>
<p>
That is, S.p.q is the sum of the elements in the array segment A[p..q).
<p>
Among the elementary observations we can make regarding S are these:
<p>
(1) S.k.k = 0 for all k (0&le;k&le;#A) because A[k..k) is an empty segment,
<br />
(2) S.k.(k+1) = A.k for all k (0&le;k&lt;#A) because A[k,k+1) is a one-element
                    segment containing only A.k
<br />
(3) S.k.n = S.k.m + S.m.n for all k,m,n satisfying 0&le;k&le;m&le;n&le;#A,
   because
<p><center>
the sum of the elements in A[k..n) &nbsp; = &nbsp;
   the sum of the elements in A[k..m) + 
   the sum of the elements in A[m..n).
</center>

<p>
As a special case of (3), take m=n-1:
<p>
(3') S.k.n = S.k.(n-1) + S.(n-1).n
<p>
which, by (2), gives us
<p>
(3'') S.k.n = S.k.(n-1) + A.(n-1)

<p>
In the Maximum Segment Sum problem, A is given as input and the output to be
produced is the maximum among all the S.p.q's.  That is, the program's
specification is
<pre><code>    |[con A : array of int;
      var z : int;
      { true }
      max_seg_sum
      {Q : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A : S.p.q) }
    ]| </code></pre>

<p>
As an example, consider the integer array 
<pre>
          0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10  11  12
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
      A | 2 |-1 |-2 | 3 | 2 |-2 | 3 |-1 | 1 |-6 | 4 |-1 | 3 | 
        +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ </pre>

<p>
The maximum among all segment sums is 6, which is achieved by each
of the following segments: A[3..6], A[3..8], A[3..12], and A[10..12].

<p>
Let us attempt to derive a solution by employing the techniques from the
course.  The first observation we can make is that we are unlikely to
find a solution that doesn't involve a loop (or recursion, or some device
for iteration).  Among our heuristics for developing loops, the one
that seems to be applicable is <b>replace a constant (in the postcondition)
by a variable</b>.  The two constants appearing in the postcondition are
<tt>0</tt> and <tt>#A</tt>.  Suppose that we replace <tt>#A</tt> 
by a "fresh" variable <tt>r</tt> in order
to obtain as a candidate for a loop invariant the following:
<p><center><tt>
          I : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)
</tt></center>
<p>
As a loop guard, we would choose <tt>B : r &ne; #A</tt>,
because then we obviously have
<tt>[I &and; &not;B ==> Q]</tt>
(as required by proof obligation (iii) with respect to loops).

<p>
Indeed, one could rewrite the postcondition as
<p><center><tt>
         z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q) &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; r = #A
</tt></center>
<p>
which strengthens the original postcondition insofar as it requires the fresh
variable <tt>r</tt> to satisfy <tt>r = #A</tt>.
Employing the <b>delete a conjunct</b> heuristic,
we get I as the suggested loop invariant and &not;(r = #A) (i.e., r &ne; #A)
as the suggested loop guard.

<p>
Our program skeleton is now

<pre><code>    |[con A : array of int;
      var z : int;
      var r : int;
      { true }
      r, z := ?, ?;
      { loop invariant I : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q) }
      do r &ne; #A  ---> 
         r, z := ?, ?
      od
      {Q : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A : S.p.q) }
    ]| </code></pre>

<p>
In order to satisfy proof obligation (i), <tt>r</tt> and <tt>z</tt>
must be initialized so as to truthify <tt>I</tt>.
The easiest way to do this is to set <tt>r</tt> to <tt>0</tt>, thereby making
the range in the quantifier correspond to <tt>p=q=0</tt>.
Applying the one-point rule (and using our above observation that
S.k.k = 0 for all k), we obtain that <tt>z</tt> should be set to zero, too.

<p>
Now consider the loop body.  Given that we have decided to initialize
<tt>r</tt> to zero and that the loop guard indicates termination when
<tt>r</tt> becomes <tt>#A</tt>, the most obvious way to modify <tt>r</tt>
inside the loop is by incrementing it.  Let's assume, for the moment
at least, that this is what we shall do.

<p>
As the expression needed on the right-hand side of the assignment command
for incrementing <tt>r</tt> does not involve any other variables, we make
it the last command within the loop body and place the command(s) that
update z before it.  (This allows us to focus upon z exclusively without
requiring that <tt>r</tt> be updated simultaneously.)
The refined (and annotated) program is as follows:
<pre><code>    |[con A : array of int;
      var z : int;
      var r : int;
      { true }
      r, z := 0, 0;
      { invariant I : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q) }
      do r &ne; #A  --->
         {I  &and;  r &ne; #A}
         z := E;
         { I(r:=r+1), i.e., wp.(r:=r+1).I }
         r := r + 1;
         {I}
      od
      {Q : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A : S.p.q) }
    ]| </code></pre>

<p>
The loop body has been annotated with pre- and post-conditions in accord with
proof obligation (ii) on the "loop checklist".  The intermediate assertion
<tt>I(r:=r+1)</tt> is motivated by the Hoare Triple Law of Catenation
(which says that <tt>{P} S;T {Q}</tt> follows from 
<tt>{P} S {R} &and; {R} T {Q})</tt> and the fact that this
assertion corresponds to <tt>wp.(r:=r+1).I</tt>,
making it the weakest predicate <tt>R</tt> satisfying <tt>{R} r:=r+1 {I}</tt>.

<p>
We have reduced our problem to that of finding E to truthify the Hoare triple
<p><center><tt>
                  {I &and; r&ne;#A} z := E { I(r:=r+1) }
</tt></center>

<p>
Let's try to calculate <tt>E</tt> using proof obligation (ii):
<pre>
    Assume I &and; r&ne;#A.

    wp.(z:=E).I(r:=r+1)

 =    < wp assignment law >

    (I(r:=r+1))(z:=E)

 =    < defn of I >

    ((z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q))(r:=r+1))(z:=E)

 =    < textual substitution >

    (z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r+1 : S.p.q))(z:=E)

 =    < textual substitution >

    E = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r+1 : S.p.q) 

 =    < rewrite range so as to "split off" terms in which q=r+1 >

    E = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r &or; 0&le;p&le;q=r+1 : S.p.q) 

 =    < range split (8.16) or (8.18) >

    E = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)  max  (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q=r+1 : S.p.q)

 =    < (Gries 8.14) One-point rule (Technically, need to use 
        (8.20) Nesting, then (8.14), and then (8.20) "in reverse".)  >

    E = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)  max  (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r+1 : S.p.(r+1))

 =    < assumption I : z = (MAX ... )  >

    E = z  max  (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r+1 : S.p.(r+1))
</pre>
<p>
At this point, we employ the <b>strengthening the invariant</b> heuristic by
introducing a fresh variable <tt>y</tt> and including as a new conjunct of the
invariant the following:
<p><center><tt>
               y = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r+1 : S.p.(r+1))
</tt></center>

</p><p>
However, there is a problem with doing this.  In order for this to hold
upon completion of the final loop iteration (at which point <tt>r = #A</tt>),
it would have to be the case that
<tt>y = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;#A+1 : S.p.(#A+1))</tt>.
But <tt>S</tt> is not defined when its second argument exceeds <tt>#A</tt>,
so it will not be possible for <tt>y</tt>'s value to satisfy this condition
(unless we insert code to cause <tt>y</tt>'s value to become "undefined",
which seems rather silly).  

</p><p>
Is there any way to circumvent this obstacle?  Well, suppose that we
decide to augment the invariant with the new conjunct
<p><center><tt>
             I<sub>2</sub>:  y = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.r)
</tt></center>

<p>
instead.  (This is exactly what we suggested above as a new conjunct, except
that we have replaced the two occurrences of <tt>r+1</tt> with <tt>r</tt>.)
Then we arrange the code in the body of the loop so that the value of
<tt>y</tt> is updated to satisfy <tt>I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1)</tt> 
<em>before</em> the assignment to <tt>z</tt>.
Note that our choice of <tt>z max y</tt> as the right-hand side of the
assignment to <tt>z</tt> is correct as long as <tt>I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1)</tt>
holds <em>at the time that that assignment is performed</em> 
(regardless of whether it was true at the beginning of the
current loop iteration).
Our program now looks like this:
<pre><code>    |[con A : array of int;
      var z,y : int;
      var r : int;
      {#A &ge; 0}
      r, z, y := 0, 0, ?;
      { invariant I : I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>, where
           I<sub>1</sub> : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)
           I<sub>2</sub> : y = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.r)
      }
      do r &ne; #A  --->
         { I &and; r&ne;#A }
         y := F;
         { I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1) }
         z := z max y;
         { (I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>)(r:=r+1), i.e., I(r:=r+1) }
         r := r + 1;
         { I }
      od
      {Q : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A : S.p.q) }
    ]| </code></pre>

<p> 
It remains to figure out how to fill in the right-hand sides of the two
assignments to <tt>y</tt>.  Given that <tt>r</tt> is initialized to zero,
the initial value of <tt>y</tt> must satisfy <tt>I<sub>2</sub>(r:=0)</tt>,
which requires that <tt>y = 0</tt>.
Hence, we initialize <tt>y</tt> to zero.
As for the assignment inside the loop, we calculate <tt>F</tt> in the
context of trying to prove
<tt>{I &and; r&ne;#A} y := F { I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1) }</tt>:

<pre>
    wp.(y:=F).(I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1))

 =     < wp assignment law >

    (I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1))(y:=F)

 =     < textual substitution distributes over operators >

    I<sub>1</sub>(y:=F) &and; (I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1))(y:=F)

 =     < defn of I<sub>1</sub>, I<sub>2</sub> and textual substitution >

    z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)  &and;  F = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r+1 : S.p.(r+1))

 =     < 1st conjunct is assumption I<sub>1</sub>; (3.39) >

    F = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r+1 : S.p.(r+1))

 =     < split off term (8.23); range is non-empty due to assumption 0&le;r >

    F = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.(r+1))  max  S.(r+1).(r+1)

 =     < from observation (1), S.(r+1).(r+1) = 0 >

    F = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.(r+1))  max  0

 =     < from observation (3''), S.p.(r+1) = S.p.r + A.r >

    F = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.r + A.r)  max  0

 =     < provided R is non-empty and there are no free occurrences
         of x in V, (MAX x | R : U + V) = (MAX x | R : U) + V      >

    F = ((MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.r) + A.r)  max  0

 =     < assumption I<sub>2</sub> >

    F = (y + A.r) max 0 </pre> 

<p>
Now we have a completed program.  In order to prove obligations (iv) and (v),
we need to include 0&le;r&le;#A as another conjunct of our loop invariant.
(Indeed, we cheated a little above in that we twice used 0&le;r as an
assumption, as though it had already been included in the invariant.)
<pre><code>    |[con A : array of int;
      var z,y : int;
      var r : int;
      {#A &ge; 0}
      r, z, y := 0, 0, 0;
      { invariant I : I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub> &and; I<sub>3</sub>, where
           I<sub>1</sub> : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;r : S.p.q)
           I<sub>2</sub> : y = (MAX p | 0&le;p&le;r : S.p.r)
           I<sub>3</sub> : 0&le;r&le;#A
      }
      { bound function t : #A - r }
      do r &ne; #A  --->
         { I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub> &and; I<sub>3</sub> &and; r&ne;#A }
         { I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub> &and; I<sub>3</sub>(r:=r+1) }
         y := (y + A.r) max 0;
         { I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub>(r:=r+1) &and; I<sub>3</sub>(r:=r+1) }
         z := z max y;
         { I(r:=r+1) }
         r := r + 1;
         { I }
      od
      {Q : z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&le;#A : S.p.q) }
