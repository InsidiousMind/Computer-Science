  Development of a program to compute prefix sums
</H2>

<p>
Let b be an integer array.  Suppose that we want to develop a
program that establishes, for all i satisfying 0&le;i&lt;#b,

<p><center><tt>b.i = B.0 + B.1 + ... + B.i</tt></center>

<p>
where B is the original value of b.  Intuitively, this means that we want
to replace the value in each element of b by the sum of all the values
(originally) occupying the prefix of b ending with that element.

<p>
A formal specification is as follows:

<pre>
|[var b : array  of int;  { b=B }

  prefixSums

  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>

where <tt>prefixSum.m = (+j | 0<=j<=m : B.j)</tt>.

<p>
Clearly, to solve this we should use a loop.  As a first step in developing
the program, we employ the heuristic of replacing a constant (in the
postcondition Q) by a fresh variable and adding a new conjunct stating
that the fresh variable is equal to that constant.
(This yields Q', a slightly strengthened form of the postcondition.)
Choosing to replace constant <tt>#b</tt> by (fresh variable) <tt>n</tt>,
we get
<p><center><tt>
Q' : (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &nbsp; &and; &nbsp; n = #b
</tt></center>
<p>
We take the modified postcondition (not including the new conjunct)
to be a candidate for a loop invariant and the negation of the new conjunct
(<tt>n&ne;#b</tt>) to be the loop guard.
<!-- in order to arrive at a possible
loop invariant.  Let us replace constant <tt>#b</tt> by (fresh variable)
<tt>n</tt>.  The appropriate loop guard is thus <tt>n &ne; #b</tt>.
-->
The loop body should involve changes to <tt>n</tt> and <tt>b</tt>.
We get:
<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;

  n := E;
  {loop invariant I: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
  do n &ne; #b  ---&gt;  n, b := F, G;
  od
  {Q': (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; n = #b }
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>
<p>
The obvious initialization for <tt>n</tt> is to make it zero, as that
truthifies <tt>I</tt>. 
Considering this, together with the loop guard, the obvious modification
to <tt>n</tt> inside the loop is to increment it.
This suggests that <tt>0&le;n&le;#b</tt> is also an invariant of the loop,
which could turn out to be important (especially in showing item <em>(iv)</em>
on the loop checklist).
It also suggests that <tt>G</tt> be of the form <tt>b(n:E)</tt>.  
That is, it would seem that each iteration of the loop should modify
<tt>b.n</tt>.  Our proposed program is then
<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;

  n := 0;
  {loop invariant I: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i)  &and;  0&le;n&le;#b }
  do n &ne; #b  ---&gt;  n, b := n+1, b(n:E);
  od
  {Q': (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; n = #b }
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>

<p>
To calculate <tt>E</tt>, we attempt to prove item (ii) of the loop checklist.
(Note the use of the 
<A HREF="irrel_ary_elem_axiom.html">Irrelevant Array Element Axiom</A>.)

<pre>
  {I &and; B} n, b := n+1, b(n:E) {I}  (i.e., [I &and; B  &rArr; wp.(n,b:=n+1,b(n:E)).I])

 Assume I and B.

    wp.(n,b := n+1,b(n:E)).I

 =    < wp law, defn. of I, text. sub >

    (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n+1 : b(n:E).i = prefixSum.i)

 =    < (8.23) split off term (note importance here of assumption 0&le;n) >

    (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b(n:E).i = prefixSum.i)  &and;  b(n:E).n = prefixSum.n

 =    < b(n:E).n = E by defn of b(n:E) >

    (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b(n:E).i = prefixSum.i)  &and;  E = prefixSum.n

 =    < b(n:E).i = b.i for all i&lt;n, which follows from 
        Irrelevant Array Element Axiom instantiated by
        R := 0&le;i&lt;n, b := b, i := i, P := b.i = prefixSum.i,
        k := n, E := E, and * := &and;                                >

    (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i)  &and;  E = prefixSum.n

 =    < 1st conjunct above is 1st conjuct of I, which is assumed; (3.39) >

    E = prefixSum.n

 =    < defn of function prefixSum >

    E = (+j | 0&le;j&le;n : B.j)
   
 =    < (8.23) Split Off Term (note importance of assumption n&ge;0) >

    E = (+j | 0&le;j&lt;n : B.j)  +  B.n

 =    < j&lt;n = j&le;n-1 (due to j and n being integers) >

    E = (+j | 0&le;j&le;n-1 : B.j)  +  B.n

 =    < defn of prefixSum >

    E = prefixSum.(n-1)  +  B.n

 =    < by assumption I, b.(n-1) = prefixSum.(n-1) >

    E = b.(n-1) + B.n
</pre>
<p>
As <tt>B</tt> is only a <b>rigid variable</b> (or what some authors call a
<b>specification variable</b>), and not a variable (or constant) that can be
referred to in the (executable code within the) program, we are not done.
Yet we realize that the loop invariant <b>must</b> say something about
<tt>B.n</tt>, or else there is no way to proceed.
Examining the program, we notice that, as any given iteration of the loop
begins, the only elements of <tt>b</tt> that have been modified
(during previous iterations) are those in <tt>b[0..n)</tt>.
Thus, it is clear that <tt>B.n = b.n</tt> is an invariant of the loop.
Indeed, we can make the stronger statement that <tt>B[n..#b) = b[n..#b)</tt>
(which, of course, is an abbreviation for
<tt>(&forall;j | n&le;j&lt;#b : B.j = b.j)</tt>)
is an invariant of the loop.
(It turns out that we <b>must</b> make this stronger statement in order
to be able to prove <em>(ii)</em> on the loop checklist (i.e., that <tt>I</tt>
is a loop invariant).  This is an example of where it is easier to prove a
stronger statement than to prove a weaker one.)
Using this, we get:

<pre>
 =    < assume I has been augmented to include
        B[n..#b) = b[n..#b) as a new conjunct      >

    E = b.(n-1) + b.n
</pre>

Thus, we have calculated an expression for <tt>E</tt>.
The resulting program is
<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;

  n := 0;
  {loop invariant I: 
     (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; 0&le;n&le;#b &and; b[n..#b)=B[n..#b)
  }
  do n &ne; #b &xrarr; n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n);
  od
  {Q': (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; n = #b }
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>

<p>
However, this program is faulty because during the loop's first iteration
an access will be made to <tt>b[-1]</tt>, which does not exist.
To repair this, we can nest a selection command within the loop body
to force different actions to be taken when <tt>n=0</tt> vs. 
(the more usual case) when <tt>n&gt;0</tt>.  Doing so, we get:

<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;

  n := 0;
  {loop invariant I: 
     (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; 0&le;n&le;#b &and; b[n..#b)=B[n..#b)
  }
  do n &ne; #b  &xrarr;
     if n=0 &xrarr;  n, b := n+1, ?; 
     [] n>0 &xrarr;  n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n);
     fi
  od
  {Q': (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; n = #b }
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>
<p>
We are left to figure out the correct assignment to <tt>b</tt> during the
loop iteration when <tt>n=0</tt> (which is, of course, the first iteration).
The intended effect of this assignment is to establish <tt>I(n:=1)</tt>,
of course.  But the relevant part of <tt>I(n:=1)</tt> simply says that 
<tt>b.0 = prefixSum.0</tt>, which is to say that <tt>b.0 = B.0</tt>.
But to establish <tt>b.0 = B.0</tt> is trivial, as the loop invariant says
that it already holds!
(From an operational point of view, <tt>B.0</tt> (the initial value of 
<tt>b.0</tt>) must be equal to <tt>b.0</tt> because no changes are made to
<tt>b.0</tt> prior to the first iteration of the loop.)
Hence, during that iteration, we need not do an assignment to <tt>b</tt> 
at all!  We get

<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;

  n := 0;
  {loop invariant I: 
     (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; 0&le;n&le;#b &and; b[n..#b)=B[n..#b)
  }
  do n &ne; #b &xrarr; 
     if n=0 &xrarr;  n := n+1; 
     [] n>0 &xrarr;  n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n);
     fi
  od
  {Q': (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; n = #b }
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|
</pre>

</p><p>
The fact that the first loop iteration has no effect except to increment
<tt>n</tt> to 1 suggests that we should initialize <tt>n</tt> to 1,
thereby eliminating the need for an iteration when <tt>n=0</tt>!
By doing that, we can modify the second conjunct of <tt>I</tt> to say 
<tt>0&lt;n&lt;#b</tt>, making unnecessary the selection command inside
the loop.

</p><p>
Unfortunately, we have introduced a new problem, namely that the program
no longer works when <tt>b</tt> has length zero (i.e., <tt>#b = 0</tt>).
Why?  Because during the first iteration of the loop (which really
shouldn't happen!), an index-out-of-range error will occur.
We can fix this by changing the loop guard to <tt>n&le;#b</tt>.
It is intuitively obvious that the resulting program will work correctly
(including in the case that <tt>#b = 0</tt>), but, in that same case, 
the loop invariant will be false after the initialization of <tt>n</tt>.

</p><p>
If we don't mind this bit of logical awkwardness (after all, you might
argue, we were simply trying to develop a correct program;
we don't really care whether the loop invariant that helped to get us
there is no longer correct), then we can live with this.

</p><p>
If, on the other hand, you are a stickler for details,
you can resolve the issue in at least three ways.
One is to strengthen the precondition to say <tt>#b&gt;0</tt>.
This is not much of a sacrifice, given that there is absolutely no need
to invoke the program in the case <tt>#b=0</tt>, as it will have no
effect.  (This solution would impose a slight burden on clients of the
program, as they would now be obligated not to invoke the program to
compute the prefix sums of an empty array.)

</p><p>
An alternative resolution would be to tweak the loop invariant
(see boldfaced subexpressions) to arrive at the following:

<pre>loop invariant I:
  (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;(<b>n min #b</b>) : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and;
  0&lt;n&le;(<b>#b max 1</b>) &and; b[n..#b)=B[n..#b)</pre>

</p><p>
A third alternative would be to nest the loop (including its initialization
code) inside one branch of a selection command, as follows:
<pre>
   if #b = 0 &xrarr; skip
   [] #b > 0 &xrarr; n := 1;
                do n &ne; #b &xrarr; n, b := n+1, b(n : b(n-1) + b.n)
                od
   fi</pre>

</p><p>
From a performance standpoint, this is superior to nesting the selection
command inside the loop (as we had in a previous version of the program)
because it is better to test the condition <tt>#b=0</tt> just once,
rather than every time around the loop.

</p><p>
Choosing the option of strengthening the pre-condition, the final program is

<pre>
|[var b : array of int;  { b=B }
  var n : int;
  {#b > 0}
  n := 1;
  {loop invariant I: 
     (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;n : b.i = prefixSum.i) &and; 0&lt;n&le;#b &and; b[n..#b)=B[n..#b)
  }
  do n &ne; #b &xrarr; n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n);
  od
  {Q: (&forall;i | 0&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = prefixSum.i) }
]|</pre>

</p><p>
Of course, the more usual way of writing the assignment to b is

</p><p>
<center><tt>b.n := b.(n-1) + b.n</tt></center>

</p><p>
There is yet another issue to address.  In calculating the right-hand side
of the assignment to <tt>b</tt>,
we strengthened the loop invariant to include the new conjunct 
<tt>b[n..#b) = B[n..#b)</tt>.  Having done so, we are responsible for
showing that execution of the loop body preserves this new conjunct.  Now,
intuitively it is obvious that if we modify <tt>b.n</tt> but also increment
<tt>n</tt>, then the truth of <tt>b[n..#b) = B[n..#b)</tt> is preserved.
(Note that the modified array element is now <tt>b.(n-1)</tt>, on which this
condition does not depend.)
But let's prove it formally, so as to illustrate, once again, the use of the 
<A HREF="irrel_ary_elem_axiom.html">Irrelevant Array Element Axiom</A>.
What we want to show is 

</p><p>
<center><tt>{I &and; B} n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n) {I}</tt></center> 

</p><p>
Letting the three conjuncts of <tt>I</tt> be <tt>I<sub>0</sub></tt>,
<tt>I<sub>1</sub></tt>, and <tt>I<sub>2</sub></tt>,
our previous work has demonstrated that 

</p><p>
<center><tt>
  {I &and; B} 
  n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n)
  {I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub>} 
</tt></center>

</p><p>
Hence, it remains to show

</p><p>
<center><tt>{I &and; B} n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n) {I<sub>2</sub>} 
</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
<b>Note</b>: <tt>I<sub>2</sub></tt>, as written above, is an
abbreviation for the expression
<!-- <p><center> -->
<tt>(&forall;i | n&le;i&lt;#b : b.i = B.i)</tt>.
<!-- </center> -->
From now on, we use this as our <tt>I<sub>2</sub></tt>.
<b>End of note.</b>

</p><p>
By the relationship between Hoare Triples and wp, 
<!-- the Hoare Triple that we wish to show -->
this is equivalent to

<p><center><tt>[I &and; B  &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp;  
                wp.(n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n)).I<sub>2</sub>]
</tt></center>
<p>
We assume the antecedent, <tt>I &and; B</tt>, and show the consequent:

<pre>
  Assume I and B.

     wp.(n, b := n+1, b(n : b.(n-1) + b.n)).I<sub>2</sub>]
