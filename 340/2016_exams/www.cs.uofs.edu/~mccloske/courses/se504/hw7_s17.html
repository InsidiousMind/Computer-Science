<h2>SE 504 Spring 2017<br />
HW #7: Strengthening the Invariant, Array Assignment, Tail Recursion<br />
Due: 5:00pm, Thursday, April 13
</h2>

</p><p>
<b>1.</b>
Develop a program with the specification shown below, and provide a narrative
that describes the steps you took in doing so.
The inputs to the program are the constant array <tt>B</tt> of reals and the
constant real number <tt>X</tt>.  The goal is to establish 

</p><p><center><em>y &nbsp;=&nbsp;
   B.0 &nbsp; + &nbsp; B.1 &times; X &nbsp; + &nbsp;
   B.2 &times; X<sup>2</sup> &nbsp; + &nbsp; ... + &nbsp;
   B.N &times; X<sup>N</sup></em>
</center>

</p><p>
where <tt>N = #B-1</tt>.
Thus, the intended program evaluates the polynomial whose coefficients
are the elements of <tt>B</tt> at the value given by <tt>X</tt>.

</p><p>
Assume that our programming language lacks an exponentiation operator 
(or an analogous function/method), or else it would be trivial to devise
a solution.
(Even if the programming language had an exponentiation operator, your
solution will be superior to one that uses it, in terms of efficiency.)

</p><p>
In deriving a candidate loop invariant from the postcondition, use the
<em>replace a constant by a fresh variable</em> heuristic.  
But this time replace the constant <b>0</b> rather than, say, <tt>#B</tt>,
which is the more obvious one to replace.
(Notice that the postcondition is written with <b>two</b> occurrences of
<tt>0</tt>, including one that would normally be omitted.  Replace
both of them by the same fresh variable.)

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">

<font size="+1">
<pre>|[ con X : real;
   con B : array of real;
   var y : real;

   y := ?

It may be helpful to recall that multiplication distributes over addition.
That is,
<font size="+1">
</p><p><center><tt>
u(v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub> + ... + v<sub>k</sub>)
&nbsp;=&nbsp;  uv<sub>1</sub> + uv<sub>2</sub> + ... + uv<sub>k</sub>
</tt></center>
</font>

</p><p>
In terms of quantification, we would put it this way:

</p><p>
<font size="+1">
<b>Theorem (Multiplication Distributes over Summation):</b>
Provided that <tt>z</tt> does not occur free in <tt>U</tt>,
</p><p>
<center>
<tt>(+z | R : U&times;V) &nbsp;=&nbsp; U&times;(+z | R : V)</tt>.
</center>
</font>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<b>2.</b> Complete the development of the program below and show a proof
of (ii) from the loop checklist.  (The four other items on the list are
easy to prove.)  Of course, <b>E</b> refers to an unknown expression.
Assume that <tt>max</tt> exists as a binary operator in our programming
language.

</p><p>
To complete the proof of (ii), you will need to augment the loop invariant
with a third conjunct in a way similar to what was done in solving the 
Prefix Sums problem.
Don't forget that <tt>B</tt> is a rigid variable and therefore cannot
be mentioned in any command.

<b>3.</b>
Consider this tail recursive definition of function 
f : &naturals; &times; &naturals; &rarr; &naturals;:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">f.m.n =</td>
  <td>{ m max n</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;if m min n = 0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>{ f.(m-1).(n-1)</td>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp;otherwise</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Using this definition, follow the standard procedure (as covered in lecture)
by which to derive a program that satisfies the specification below 
(in which M and N are the inputs).
The function <b>f</b> is the composition of two functions that are
familiar to you.  Identify that composition.

</p><p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<font size="+1">
<pre><code>|[ con M, N : int;   { M,N &ge; 0 }
   var z : int;

   z := ?

   {Q: z = f.M.N }
]|</code></pre>
</font>

<b>4.</b>
Consider this pseudo-tail recursive function definition of
R : list&lt;T&gt; &rarr; list&lt;T&gt;, which uses the
list notation introduced in Problem 3 of Homework #5.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0" cellpadding="1">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2">R.x =&nbsp;</td>
  <td>{ empty</td><td>&nbsp; &nbsp;if x = empty</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>{ R.(tail.x) &nbsp;|&nbsp; [head.x]</td>
  <td>&nbsp; &nbsp;otherwise</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Using this definition, follow the standard procedure (as covered in lecture)
by which to derive a program that satisfies the specification below (in which
<tt>T</tt> stands for an arbitary data type).

</p><p>
As an intermediate step, from the given definition of function <tt>R</tt>
you can derive a (fully) tail recursive definition for function <tt>R'</tt>
such that (for all lists <tt>x</tt>)&nbsp; <tt>R'.x.empty = R.x</tt>.

</p><p>
Notice that in the recursive case of the definition, the application of
<tt>R</tt> is the <b>left</b> operand of the <b>concatenate</b> 
(or <b>append</b>, if you prefer) operator, not the right operand.  
This is the opposite of the template that we covered in lecture, which
means that the roles being played by the two operands here are reversed,
which you must take account of.
