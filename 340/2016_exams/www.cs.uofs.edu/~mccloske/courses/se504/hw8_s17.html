<h2>SE 504 Spring 2015<br />
HW #8: Longest Common Subsequences Revisited<br />
Due: 7:20pm, Tuesday, May 9
</h2>

</p><p>
The Java class <a href="LongComSubseq_504_S17.java">LongComSubseq_504_S17</a>
is a Java translation of the DGCL (Dijkstra's Guarded Command Language) program
that we developed in lecture pertaining to the <b>Longest Common Subsequence
Problem</b>.  (Also see the corresponding web page.)

</p><p>
The given program, when given two character strings <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>, 
computes a table containing the values of the LLCS function ("Length of
Longest Common Subsequence") with respect to <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt>.  
(Recall that LLCS.i.j = the length of a LCS (i.e., longest common subsequence)
of x[0..i) and y[0..j).)  (In lecture we assumed that sequences were indexed
beginning at one rather than zero, but because Java index ranges begin at
zero, here we conform to that.)

<hr>
</p><p>
<b>1.</b>
The program's <tt>longestCommonSubsequence()</tt> method, which computes 
one member of the set of LCS's, was left blank.  Complete it.

</p><p>
It should be clear that the <tt>llcs[][]</tt> instance variable
(which contains the values of the LLCS function) provides all the 
information necessary to compute any and all members of the set
of LCS's.
Make sure to annotate your code with comments that indicate an
invariant and bound function for every loop.


<hr>
</p><p>
<b>2.</b> (Challenging)
The program's <tt>numWaysToFormLCS()</tt> method, which computes 
the number of distinct ways that LCS's can be formed,
was left blank.  Complete it.
As was the case for Problem 1, the <tt>llcs[][]</tt> instance variable
contains information sufficient for doing the calculations.

</p><p>
The purpose of the following is to make more precise what is
meant by a "way that an LCS can be formed" and to provide
some hints as to how to solve the problem.

</p><p>
Consider, for example, the character sequences 
<tt>X: adbcbca</tt> and <tt>Y: bdaab</tt>.
<!-- <tt>X: adbcbcac</tt> and <tt>Y: bdaabc</tt>. -->

</p><p>
The set of LCS's of X and Y is 
<tt>{ aa, ab, ba, bb, da, db }</tt>.
<!-- <tt>{ aac, abc, bac, bbc, dac, dbc }</tt>. -->

</p><p>
Now, for each common subsequence there is at least one way to
form it, but possibly more.  To clarify what we mean by that,
we define a <b>common subsequence index sequence</b> (with respect to
sequences X and Y) to be a list of ordered pairs of natural numbers
</p</p>
<center>
<tt>&lt;(i<sub>1</sub>,j<sub>1</sub>), (i<sub>2</sub>,j<sub>2</sub>), ...
(i<sub>k</sub>,j<sub>k</sub>)&gt;</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
satisfying the condition that both
<tt>&lt;i<sub>1</sub>,i<sub>2</sub>, ... ,i<sub>k</sub>&gt;</tt> and
<tt>&lt;j<sub>1</sub>,j<sub>2</sub>, ... ,j<sub>k</sub>&gt;</tt> are strictly increasing sequences  and
<tt>X.i<sub>m</sub> = Y.j<sub>m</sub></tt> for all <tt>m = 1..k</tt>

</p><p>
Of course, such an index sequence describes one way of forming the
common subsequence 
<tt>X.i<sub>1</sub> &oplus; X.i<sub>2</sub> &oplus; ... 
&oplus; X.i<sub>k</sub></tt>, 
which is necessarily equal to
<tt>Y.j<sub>1</sub> &oplus; Y.j<sub>2</sub> &oplus; 
... &oplus; Y.j<sub>k</sub></tt>.

</p><p>
Here we are using <tt>&oplus;</tt> as a concatenation operator on sequences.

</p><p>
For example, there are four common subsequence index sequences by
which common subsequence &nbsp;<tt>ba</tt>&nbsp; is formed: 

</p><p>
<center>
<tt>&lt;(3,1),(7,3)&gt;</tt><br />
<tt>&lt;(3,1),(7,4)&gt;</tt><br />
<tt>&lt;(5,1),(7,3)&gt;</tt><br />
<tt>&lt;(5,1),(7,4)&gt;</tt><br />
</center>

</p><p>
Let <tt>NLCS.m.n =</tt> the number of distinct common subsequence 
index sequences describing LCS's of X[0..m) and Y[0..n).


</p><p>
For our example of <tt>X: adbcbca</tt> and <tt>Y: bdaab</tt>,
the final answer will be 14, as the number of ways to form
<tt>aa</tt>, <tt>ab</tt>, <tt>ba</tt>, <tt>bb</tt>, <tt>da</tt>,
and <tt>db</tt> are 1, 4, 4, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.

</p><p>
The key to arriving at a solution is to properly characterize the value of
<tt>NLCS.m.n </tt> (for <tt>m,n &gt; 0</tt>) in terms of 
<tt>NLCS.m.(n-1)</tt>, <tt>NLCS.(m-1).n</tt>, and 
<tt>NLCS.(m-1).(n-1)</tt>.  
(However, this characterization is a little more complicated than the
analogous characterization of <tt>LLCS.m.n</tt> in terms of
<tt>LLCS.m.(n-1)</tt>, <tt>LLCS.(m-1).n</tt>, and 
<tt>LLCS.(m-1).(n-1)</tt>.)

</p><p>
One observation that may be crucial in understanding the various
recursive cases of <tt>NLCS</tt> follows from the fact that 
<tt>LLCS</tt> ascends along its rows, columns, and diagonals, 
but by at most one at each step:
<blockquote>
  If <tt>LLCS.m.n = w </tt> (where <tt>m,n &gt; 0</tt>), then each of 
  <tt>LLCS.m.(n-1)</tt>, <tt>LLCS.(m-1).n</tt>, and <tt>LLCS.(m-1).(n-1)</tt>
  is either <tt>w-1</tt> or <tt>w</tt>.
</blockquote>

</p><p>
One can picture it like this, where we focus on one two-by-two section
of a table holding the values of <tt>LLCS</tt>:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><th></th><th>n-1</th><th>n</th></tr>
<tr><th>m</th><td>w-1 or w</td><td><center>w</center></td></tr>
<tr><th>m-1</th><td>w-1 or w</td><td>w-1 or w</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Assuming that the value in the cell at location (m,n) is w, each of the
remaining three cells must contain either w-1 or w (two possibilities),
which makes for 2<sup>3</sup>, or 8, possible cases.
However, only five of those cases can occur in an <tt>LLCS</tt> table,
again due to the fact that it must ascend along rows and columns.
