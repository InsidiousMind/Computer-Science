HW #6: Assignment to Array Elements and More Strengthening the Invariant</br />
Due: 7:30pm, Monday, April 3<br />

</p><p>
<b>1.</b> Calculate (and simplify as much as possible)
<br />
<b>(a)</b> <tt>wp.(b.k := j).(b.j = b.k)</tt> <br />
<b>(b)</b> <tt>wp.(b.(b.k) := b.j).(b.j != b.k)</tt>

<b>2.</b>
Modify the program developed in class for the Maximum Segment Sum problem
(see the relevant web page) so that, in addition to the variable <tt>z</tt>,
there are two other "output" variables, <tt>left</tt> and <tt>right</tt>,
which (when the program completes execution) satisfy the condition that
<tt>A[left..right)</tt> is a segment with the maximum sum.


</p><p>
It is important not only to modify the program correctly but also to
modify the postcondition and loop invariant properly, i.e., so that
items (i) and (ii) on the loop checklist are provable.
(Obviously, both the postcondition and loop invariant need to
mention <tt>S.left.right</tt> (i.e., the sum of the elements in
array segment <tt>A[left..right)</tt>.)
Indeed, solutions that include a proof of (ii) will be looked upon
favorably relative to those that don't.

</p><p>
It may make your task easier if you consider that the assignment
commands <tt>y := (y + A.r) max 0</tt> and <tt>z := z max y</tt>
that appear in our Maximum Segment Sum solution are equivalent to
selection commands as indicated here:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
  <th>Assignment Command</th><th>Equivalent Selection Command</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>y := (y + A.r) max 0</tt></td>
  <td><tt>if y + A.r &ge; 0 &xrarr; y := y + A.r<br />
          [] y + A.r &le; 0 &xrarr; y := 0<br />
          fi</tt>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>z := z max y</tt></td>
  <td><tt>if z &ge; y &xrarr; skip<br />
          [] z &le; y &xrarr; z := y<br />
          fi</tt>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
For extra credit, have your program ensure that <tt>A[left..right)</tt>
is a <b>longest</b> segment with the maximum sum.  In other words, any
segment that is longer must also have a strictly smaller sum.

<!--  Following was included in HW #7 from Spring 2012, but omitted here.
</p><p>
For even more extra credit, also make your program ensure that
<tt>A[left..right)</tt> is <em>rightmost</em> among all
longest segments having maximum sum.
(In other words, not only must any segment longer than
<tt>A[left..right)</tt> have a smaller sum but also any other
equal-length segment with the same sum must begin "to the left" of
location <tt>left</tt>.)

<b>3.</b>
Derive a solution (and provide an accompanying narrative) to the
following programming problem:
<pre><code>|[ con A : array of int;  { #A > 0 }
   var z : int;

   S

   {Q: z = (MAX p,q | 0&le;p&le;q&lt;#A : A.q - A.p) }
]|
</code></pre>

</p><p>
The methods used in deriving the program for the Maximum Segment Sum problem
(see relevant web page) will be useful here.
In particular, notice the step in the derivation of <tt>E</tt> in which
either (8.16) or (8.18) (two versions of <b>range split</b>) is applied,
followed by the (combined) step in which (8.20), (8.14), and (8.20) (again)
are applied.

</p><p>
Also note that subtraction distributes over <tt>max</tt> in a particular
way, producing a <tt>min</tt>.
That is, 
</p><p><center><tt>
(u - v<sub>1</sub>) max (u - v<sub>2</sub>) max ... max (u - v<sub>k</sub>) 
= u - (v<sub>1</sub> min v<sub>2</sub> min ... min v<sub>k</sub>)
</tt></center>

</p><p>
In terms of quantification, this can be stated as
</p><p>
<b>Theorem (Subtraction Distributes over max to obtain min):</b>
Provided that <tt>x</tt> does not occur free in <tt>U</tt>,
<tt>(MAX x | R : U - V) = U - (MIN x | R : V)</tt>

<!-- The following would apply if the body of the MAX quantification were
     A.p - A.q.  But I changed it, failing to recognize that the reasoning
     is a bit more tricky as a result.
</p><p>
Also note that subtraction (and addition) distribute over <tt>max</tt>.
That is, 
</p><p><center><tt>
(u<sub>1</sub> - v) max (u<sub>2</sub> - v) max ... max (u<sub>k</sub> - v) 
= (u<sub>1</sub> max u<sub>2</sub> max ... max u<sub>k</sub>) - v
</tt></center>

</p><p>
In terms of quantification, this can be stated as
</p><p>
<b>Theorem (Subtraction Distributes over max):</b>
Provided that <tt>x</tt> does not occur free in <tt>V</tt>,
<tt>(MAX x | R : U - V) = (MAX x | R : U) - V</tt>
