SE 504 <br />
Computing N<sup>3</sup>
Without using Multiplication or Exponentiation<br />
(An Example of Applying the Strengthening the Invariant Heuristic)
</H2>

</p><p>
<b>Problem:</b> 
Develop a solution to the following specification.  In order to make
it interesting, assume that the programming language has no multiplication or
exponentiation operations.
</p><p>
<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 } 
   var r : int; 
   compute_cube 
   { Q: r = N<sup>3</sup> } 
]|
</pre></code>

</p><p>
Because we are not to use multiplication or exponentiation, it would seem that
a solution will include at least one loop.  Applying the "replace a constant
by a fresh variable" heuristic to arrive at a strengthened version of the
postcondition, we get 

</p><p><center>
  <code>Q': r = n<sup>3</sup> &and; n = N</code>
</center>

</p><p>
From Q' we take the first conjunct to be a possible loop invariant
and the negation of the second to be the loop's guard.
These choices immediately give us (iii) in the loop checklist.

</p><p>
What we have so far, then, is

<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 }
   var r : int;
   var n : int;

   n,r := ?,?;   <!-- E<sub>0</sub>, E<sub>1</sub>; -->
   { I : r=n<sup>3</sup> }
   do n &ne; N  ---&gt;
      n,r := ?,?;  <!-- F<sub>0</sub>,F<sub>1</sub>; -->
   od
   { Q': r=n<sup>3</sup> &and; n=N }
   { Q : r = N<sup>3</sup> }
]|
</pre></code>

</p><p>
What remains is to determine, for variables <code>n</code> and 
<code>r</code>, to what values to initialize them and 
how to update them during each iteration of the loop.

</p><p>
To truthify the loop invariant, we need to establish 
<code>r=n<sup>3</sup></code>.
The most obvious choice is to initialize <code>n</code> to 0,
which would dictate that <code>r</code> be initialized to zero, too.
This choice also suggests that <code>n</code> be incremented during
each iteration of the loop, which would eventually result in its
being equal to <code>N</code> so that the loop would terminate.

</p><p>
Alternatively, we could, for example, choose to initialize <code>n</code>
to 7, which would dictate that <code>r</code> be initialized to
343 (7<sup>3</sup>).
But since we don't know ahead of time whether <code>N&gt;7</code> or
<code>N&lt;7</code>, our loop body would have to accommodate not only
the possibility of <code>n&lt;N</code> but also <code>n&gt;N</code>,
which, we suspect, would complicate things considerably.

</p><p>
Therefore, the most obvious choice would seem to be best, too.
<!--  This was stupid:
(For any other value of <code>n</code>, it is not clear how we could 
initialize <code>r</code> to <code>n<sup>3</sup></code> without using
multiplication, exponentiation, or another loop.)  The fact that <code>n</code>
will be initialized to a "small" value suggests that it be incremented each
time around the loop.  The fact that <code>N</code> could be zero suggests
that we initialize n to zero rather than one.
-->
Our refined program is

<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 }
   var r : int;
   var n : int;

   n,r := 0,0;
   { I : r=n<sup>3</sup> }
   do n &ne; N  ---&gt;
      n,r := n+1,F;
   od
   { Q': r=n<sup>3</sup> &and; n=N }
   { Q : r = N<sup>3</sup> }
]|
</pre></code>

</p><p>
It remains to calculate F.  We need F to be an expression that truthifies the
following Hoare triple (in accord with item (ii) on loop checklist):

</p><p><center><code>{I &and; B} n,r := n+1,F {I}</code></center>

</p><p>
Equivalently, this is <code>[I &and; B  &rArr;  wp.(n,r := n+1,F).I]</code>.
So, we assume <code>I &and; B</code> and attempt to prove 
<code>wp.(...).I</code>:

<pre>
     wp.(n,r := n+1,F).I

  =    < wp assignment law >

     I(n,r := n+1,F)

  =    < defn of I, textual sub. >

     F = (n+1)<sup>3</sup>

  =    < algebra >

     F = n<sup>3</sup> + 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1

  =    < assumption: r = n<sup>3</sup> >

     F = r + 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1
</pre>

</p><p>
At this point, we use the <b>strengthen the invariant</b> heuristic, by which
we augment the invariant to include <code>s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1</code>
as a new conjunct, where <code>s</code> is a <em>fresh</em> variable.
Continuing from above, we get

<pre>
  =    < assumption: s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1 >

     F = r + s
</pre>

</p><p>
But now we must insert code that correctly initializes <code>s</code> and
that correctly updates <code>s</code> during each iteration of the loop.
Our updated program is

<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 }
   var r : int;
   var n,s : int;

   n,r,s := 0,0,E;
   { I : r=n<sup>3</sup>  &and;  s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1 }
   do n &ne; N  --->
      n,r,s := n+1,r+s,F;
   od
   { Q': r=n<sup>3</sup> &and; n=N }
   { Q : r = N<sup>3</sup> }
]|
</pre></code>

</p><p>
Clearly, the correct choice for E is 1.  To calculate F, we attempt to find
an expression F that truthifies the Hoare triple

</p><p><center><code>{I &and; B} n,r,s := n+1,r+s,F {I}</code></center>

</p><p>
(where I is the updated version that includes
<code>s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1</code> as a conjunct).


<pre>    
     wp.(n,r,s := n+1,r+s,F).I

  =    < wp assignment law, defn of I, textual sub. >

     r+s = (n+1)<sup>3</sup>  &and;  F = 3(n+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3(n+1) + 1

  =    < 1st conjunct follows from earlier derivation, (3.39) >

     F = 3(n+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3(n+1) + 1

  =    < algebra >

     F = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 9n + 7

  =    < assumption: s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1 > 

     F = s + 6n + 6

  =    < 6n =  n + n + n + n + n + n >

     F = s + n + n + n + n + n + n + 6
</pre>

<p>
Thus, we could plug in for F the expression derived above in order to
complete the program.  However, this expression is not very elegant.  So,
instead, let's strengthen the invariant once again by introducing a
fresh variable <code>w</code>:

<pre>
     F = s + 6n + 6

  =    < assumption: w = 6n + 6 >

     F = s + w
</pre>

<p>
Of course, we must initialize <code>w</code> and update it on each
loop iteration.  Our updated program is

<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 }
   var r : int;
   var n,s,w : int;

   n,r,s,w := 0,0,1,E;
   { I : r=n<sup>3</sup>  &and;  s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  &and;  w = 6n + 6 }
   do n &ne; N  --->
      n,r,s,w := n+1,r+s,s+w,F;
   od
   { r=n<sup>3</sup> &and; n=N }
   { Q : r = N<sup>3</sup> }
]|
</pre></code>

<p>
Clearly, the correct choice for E is 6.  To calculate F, we attempt to find
an expression F that truthifies the Hoare triple

<p><center><code>{I &and; B} n,r,s,w := n+1,r+s,s+w,F {I}</code></center>

<p>
(where I is the updated version that includes <code>t = 6n + 6</code>
as a conjunct).

<pre>    
     wp.(n,r,s,w := n+1,r+s,s+w,F).I

  =    < wp assignment law, defn of I, textual sub. >

     r+s = (n+1)<sup>3</sup>  &and;  s+w = 3(n+1)<sup>2</sup> + 3(n+1) + 1  &and;  F = 6(n+1) + 6 

  =    < earlier derivations showed 1st two conjuncts, (3.39) >

     F = 6(n+1) + 6

  =    < algebra >

     F = 6n + 12

  =    < algebra >

     F = 6n + 6 + 6

  =    < assumption: w = 6n + 6 >

     F = w + 6
</pre>

</p><p>
Recognizing that we need a bound function and support in the loop invariant
for showing items (iv) and (v) on the loop checklist, we offer the following
as the final program. 

<code><pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&ge;0 }
   var r : int;
   var n,s,w : int;

   n,r,s,w := 0,0,1,7;
   { bound t : N - n }
   { I : r=n<sup>3</sup>  &and;  s = 3n<sup>2</sup> + 3n + 1  &and;  w = 6n + 6 &and; 0&le;n&le;N }
   do n &ne; N  --->
      n,r,s,w := n+1,r+s,s+w,w+6;
   od
   { Q': r=n<sup>3</sup> &and; n=N }
   { Q : r = N<sup>3</sup> }
]|
</pre></code>
