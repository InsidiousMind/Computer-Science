<h2>SE 504 <br />
Proof of Correctness of a Linear Search Program
</h2>

<p>
Note that this is a variation on what appears on pages 131-134 of
<em>Programming in the 1990's</em>, by Cohen.

</p><p>
Given the following specification, devise a program that meets it, and
prove the program's correctness.

<pre>|[ con N : int;  { N>0 }
   con b : array [0..N) of bool;  { (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N : b.j) }
   var k : int;

   find_first_true

   {Q: b.k  &and;  (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) }
]| </pre>

</p><p>
In informal terms, the above specification describes a program that, given
a fixed boolean array <tt>b[0..N)</tt> containing at least one occurrence
of <b>true</b>, 
terminates with variable <tt>k</tt> equal to the lowest-numbered location
containing <b>true</b>.
<!--finds the location <tt>k</tt> of the first such occurrence. -->

</p><p>
Let us refer to the two conjuncts of postcondition <tt>Q</tt> as 
<tt>Q<sub>0</sub></tt> and <tt>Q<sub>1</sub></tt>.

</p><p>
It would seem that, in order to find an occurrence of <b>true</b> in a
boolean array, it is necessary to search for it using a loop.
One of the <em>heuristics</em> for developing a loop is sometimes called
<b>deleting a conjunct</b>.
It suggests that we take the loop invariant to be the same as the
postcondition, except with one (or more) of its conjuncts omitted.
The negation of the omitted conjunct(s) is taken to be the guard of the loop.
Applying that heuristic here, suppose that we take <tt>Q<sub>1</sub></tt> 
to be the loop invariant and <tt>&not;Q<sub>0</sub></tt> to be the loop guard.
(The opposite choice would not have been wise, as it would have required
us to initialize <tt>k</tt> so as to establish <tt>b.k</tt>, which
is almost as difficult as the original problem.)

</p><p>
Keeping in mind that we should initialize the variable k prior to the loop,
we get
<pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N>0 }
   con b : array [0..N) of bool;  { (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N : b.j) }
   var k : int;
   k := ?;
   {invariant I: (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) }
   do &not;b.k  --->  ?
   od
   {postcondition Q: b.k  &and;  (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) }
]| </pre>

</p><p>
The loop guard is <tt>&not;b.k</tt>.
As the index range of <tt>b</tt> is <tt>[0..N)</tt>, evaluation 
of the guard in a state in which <tt>k&lt;0</tt> or <tt>k&ge;N</tt> 
results in abortion (due to an "array subscript out-of-bounds error").
Hence, we should include <tt>0&le;k&lt;N</tt>
(equivalently, <tt>0&le;k &and; k&lt;N</tt>) 
as another conjunct in the loop invariant.
That is, we augment <tt>I</tt> to become 
<tt>I: (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j)  &and;  0&le;k  &and;  k&lt;N</tt>.

</p><p>
To what value should we initialize <tt>k</tt>?
As the loop immediately follows, the initialization of <tt>k</tt> 
must result in a state satisfying the loop invariant.
Examining the invariant, we notice that, if <tt>k</tt> has value zero,
the universal quantification in <tt>I</tt> has an empty range,
which makes it true.
(To prove this, use (9.2), (3.75), and (9.8) from Gries &amp; Schneider.)
Hence, we choose <tt>k := 0</tt> as our initialization.

</p><p>
Now consider the body of the loop.  The only variable in the program is
<tt>k</tt>; hence, the loop body should modify <tt>k</tt> in some way.
Because the loop invariant says that every value in <tt>b[0..k)</tt> is
<b>false</b> and we are trying to find the first element that is <b>true</b>,
it would seem that the appropriate way to change <tt>k</tt> is to increase it
by one.  (If we increase it by more than one, we may "miss" the first element
containing <b>true</b>; if we fail to increase <tt>k</tt> at all,
the next loop iteration cannot possibly find the first occurrence
of <b>true</b>, as we already know that <b>true</b> does not occur in
<tt>b[0..k]</tt>.  (The loop invariant <tt>I</tt> tells us that <b>true</b>
fails to occur in <tt>b[0..k)</tt> and the loop guard <tt>&not;b.k</tt>
tells us that <tt>b.k</tt> is not <b>true</b>.)

</p><p>
What about a bound function?  As <tt>k</tt> increases during every
loop iteration (in accord with what we said in the previous paragraph),
one possible bound function is <tt>t: C-k</tt>, where <tt>C</tt> is
some constant that <tt>k</tt> cannot possibly exceed.
(Such a choice for the bound function guarantees that its value will decrease
on every iteration, in compliance with checkpoint (v), and that its value
will never fall below the lower bound of zero, in compliance with (iv).)
As <tt>k</tt>'s value should never go as high as <tt>N</tt> 
(because the precondition tells us that we should find a <b>true</b>
element somewhere within <tt>b[0..N)</tt>), we choose bound function
<tt>t: N-k</tt>.

</p><p>
What we have, then, is
<pre>
|[ con N : int;  { N&gt;0 }
   con b : array [0..N) of bool;  { (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N : b.j) }
   var k : int;
   k := 0;
   {invariant I: (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j)  &and;  0&le;k  &and;  k&lt;N }
   {bound t: N-k }
   do &not;b.k  --->  k := k+1
   od
   {postcondition Q: b.k  &and;  (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) }
]| </pre>

</p><p>
Let us now prove the five items on the <b>loop checklist</b>.
Note that any assertion made in the program about one of its constants
can be taken to be a "global invariant" and can be assumed in proving
any of the five items.
(For example, we can make use of the fact that <tt>N&gt;0</tt>.)
For convenience, we refer to the three conjuncts of <tt>I</tt> as 
<tt>I<sub>0</sub></tt>, <tt>I<sub>1</sub></tt>, and <tt>I<sub>2</sub></tt>.

</p><p>
<b>(i)</b> <tt>{P} S<sub>init</sub> {I}</tt>
    (equivalently, <tt>[P ==> wp.S<sub>init</sub>.I]</tt>)
</p><p>
As no precondition <tt>P</tt> is explicitly given in the program
(aside from the global invariants already mentioned), we take it to be
<b>true</b>.
<pre>
    wp.S<sub>init</sub>.I

 =    < defn of S<sub>init</sub> >

    wp.(k := 0).I

 =    < wp assignment law >

    I(k:=0)

 =    < defn of I, textual sub. >

    (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;0 : &not;b.j)  &and;  0&le;0  &and;  0&lt;N 

 =    < 0&le;0 is trivial (reflexivity of &le;), 0&lt;N is assumed, (3.39) >

    (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;0 : &not;b.j) 

 =    < 0&le;j&lt;0  =  false >

    (&forall;j | false : &not;b.j) 

 =    < (9.2); (3.75); (9.8) >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
<b>(ii)</b> <tt>{I &and; &not;b.k} k := k+1 { I }</tt>
    (equivalently, <tt>[I &and; &not;b.k ==> wp.(k:=k+1).I]</tt>)
</p><p>
We (attempt to) prove <tt>wp.(k:=k+1).I</tt> using <tt>I</tt> and 
<tt>&not;b.k</tt> as assumptions.

<pre>
    wp.(k:=k+1).I

 =    < wp assignment law >

    I(k:=k+1)

 =    < defn of I, textual sub. >

    (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k+1 : &not;b.j)  &and;  0&le;k+1  &and;  k+1&lt;N 

 =    < split off term (8.23) >

    (&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) &and; &not;b.k  &and;  0&le;k+1  &and;  k+1&lt;N 

 =    < 1st conjunct above is assumption I<sub>0</sub>; second is assumed, too; (3.39) >

    0&le;k+1  &and;  k+1&lt;N 

 =    < 0&le;k+1 follows from assumption I<sub>1</sub>; (3.39) >

    k+1&lt;N 

 =    < algebra >

    k&lt;N-1
</pre>

</p><p>
At this point, we get stuck!  It remains to show that <tt>k&lt;N-1</tt> 
is true, assuming <tt>I &and; &not;b.k</tt>.
In other words, it remains to show <tt>[I &and; &not;b.k ==> k&lt;N-1]</tt>.
We have
<pre>
    I &and; &not;b.k  ==>  k&lt;N-1

 =    < contrapositive (3.61) >

    &not;(k&lt;N-1)  ==>  &not;(I &and; &not;b.k)

 =    < &not;(a&lt;b) = a&ge;b; DeMorgan (3.47a), (3.12) >

    k &ge; N-1  ==>  &not;I &or; b.k

 =    < defn of &ge; : a&ge;b  =  a&gt;b &or; a=b >

    (k&gt;N-1 &or; k=N-1)  ==>  &not;I &or; b.k

 =    < (3.78) >

    (k&gt;N-1 ==> &not;I &or; b.k)  &and;  (k=N-1 ==> &not;I &or; b.k)
</pre>

</p><p>
Thus, it suffices to prove each of the two conjuncts of the above.  We prove
the first by assuming its antecedant (<tt>k&gt;N-1</tt>)
and showing its consequent:
<pre>
    &not;I &or; b.k

 =    < defn of I >

    &not;((&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j)  &and;  0&le;k  &and;  k&lt;N)  &or;  b.k

 =    < DeMorgan (3.47a)  >

    &not;(&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  &not;(k&lt;N)  &or;  b.k

 =    < generalized DeMorgan (9.17); (3.12); &not;(a&lt;b) = a&ge;b >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  k&ge;N  &or;  b.k

 =    < assumption k&gt;N-1 is equivalant to 3rd disjunct above >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  true  &or;  b.k

 =    < (3.29) >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
Now we prove the 2nd conjunct (again, by assuming the antecedant
(<tt>k=N-1</tt>) and showing the consequent):

<pre>
    &not;I &or; b.k

 =    < repeating the first three steps from proof of 1st conjunct >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  k&ge;N  &or;  b.k

 =    < split off term (8.23) >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k+1 : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  k&ge;N 

 =    < assumption k=N-1 and (3.84a) >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N-1+1 : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  k&ge;N 

 =    < algebra >

    (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N : b.j)  &or;  &not;(0&le;k)  &or;  k&ge;N 

 =    < 1st disjunct above is global invariant >

    true  &or;  ...

 =    < (3.29) >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
This completes the proof of item (ii) in the loop checklist!!

</p><p>
<b>(iii)</b> <tt>[I &and; &not;B ==> Q]</tt>
</p><p>
We need not even go through the proof, because the invariant and loop
guard were chosen to satisfy this!  The loop invariant <tt>I</tt> is 
<tt>I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub></tt>, the loop guard is <tt>&not;B</tt>,
and the postcondition is <tt>Q: I<sub>0</sub> &and; B</tt>.  Hence, we have

<pre>
    I &and; &not;B

 =     < I is I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; P2 >

    I<sub>0</sub> &and; I<sub>1</sub> &and; I<sub>2</sub> &and; &not;B

==>    < (3.76b) > 

    I<sub>0</sub> &and; &not;B

 =     < Q is I<sub>0</sub> &and; &not;B >

   Q 
</pre>    

</p><p>
Postponing checkpoint (iv), we now do (v):

</p><p>
<b>(v)</b> <tt>{I &and; &not;&not;b.k &and; N-k=C} k:=k+1 { N-k&lt;C }</tt>
<pre>
    wp.(k:=k+1).(N-k < C)

 =    < wp assignment law >

    (N-k < C)(k:=k+1)

 =    < textual sub. >

    N - (k+1) < C

 =    < assumption N-k=C >

    N - (k+1) < N-k

 =    < algebra >

    0 < 1

 =    < number theory !! >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
Finally, let us prove loop checkpoint (iv):

</p><p>
<b>(iv)</b> <tt>[I &and; &not;b.k ==> N-k > 0]</tt>.

<pre>
    N-k > 0

 =    < algebra >

    N > k

 =    < assumption I<sub>2</sub>: k&lt;N >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
Just for fun, let's show that, even if neither <tt>I<sub>1</sub></tt> nor <tt>I<sub>2</sub></tt>
were included as conjuncts of <tt>I</tt>, we could still carry out a proof
of (iv).  That is, we will show <tt>[I<sub>0</sub> &and; &not;b.k ==> N-k > 0]</tt>.
To do this, we show its contrapositive, 

                 <tt>[N <= k  ==>  &not;I<sub>0</sub> &or; b.k]</tt>

by assuming the antecedant and proving the consequent.

<pre>
     &not;I<sub>0</sub> &or; b.k

  =    < defn of I<sub>0</sub> >

     &not;(&forall;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : &not;b.j) &or; b.k

  =    < generalized De Morgan (9.17) >

     (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k : b.j) &or; b.k

  =    < Split off term (8.23) >

     (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;k+1 : b.j)

  =    < from assumption N&le;k it follows
         that (0&le;j&lt;k+1)  =  (0&le;j&lt;N &or; N&le;j&lt;k+1) >

     (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N &or; N&le;j&lt;k+1 : b.j) 

  =    < Range Split (8.16) >

     (&exist;j | 0&le;j&lt;N : b.j) &or; (&exist;j | N&le;j&lt;k+1 : b.j) 

  =    < 1st conjunct above is assumed "global invariant" >

     true  v  (&exist;j | N&le;j&lt;k+1 : b.j)

  =    < true is zero of disjunction (3.29) >

     true
</pre>
