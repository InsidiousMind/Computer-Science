Developing an Iterative Program to Compute a Tail Recursive Function
</h2>

A <b>tail recursive</b> function is one for which there exists a
definition of the following form:

</p><p>
<center>
<font size="+1">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2"><tt>H.x &nbsp;=&nbsp;</tt><font size="+4">{</font></td>
  <td><tt>f.x</tt></td>
  <td><tt>if b.x</tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt> H.(g.x)</tt></td>
  <td><tt>otherwise (i.e., &not;b.x)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</font>
</center>

<!--
<font size="+1">
<pre>
H.x = { f.x      if b.x
      { H.(g.x)  otherwise (i.e., &not;b.x)
</pre>
</font>
-->

</p><p>
where b, f, and g are functions that can be defined without reference to H.
For some types S and T, the signatures of these functions are
</p><p>
<center><tt>
        H : S &rarr; T,   b : S &rarr; bool,  f : S &rarr; T, and 
        g : S &rarr; S<br />
</tt></center>

</p><p>
Note that either or both of the types S and T may themselves be cartesian
products of types (e.g., S = S<sub>1</sub> &times; S<sub>2</sub>)
so that the definition of tail recursive function
should be understood to apply not only to functions of one argument
but also to multi-argument functions.
If, for example, we had S = S<sub>1</sub> &times; S<sub>2</sub>
and we preferred to view H &mdash;as well as f, b, and g&mdash; as being
two-argument functions, we could write the definition of H as follows:

<center>
<font size="+1">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1">
<tr>
  <td rowspan="2"><tt>H.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub> =&nbsp;</tt>
     <font size="+4">{</font>
  </td>
  <td><tt>f.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub></tt></td>
  <td><tt>if b.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub></tt></td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><tt>H.(g<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub>).(g<sub>2</sub>.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub>)</tt> 
  </td>
  <td><tt>otherwise (i.e., &not;b.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub>)</tt></td>
</tr>
</table>
</font>
</center>

</p><p>
(Here we have that <tt>g<sub>1</sub></tt> and <tt>g<sub>2</sub></tt> 
are such that <tt>g.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub> = (g<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub>, g<sub>2</sub>.x<sub>1</sub>.x<sub>2</sub></tt>).)

</p><p>
The generalization of this to
S = S<sub>1</sub> &times; S<sub>2</sub> &times; ... &times; S<sub>k</sub> 
(k &gt; 2) should be obvious.

</p><p>
What makes these definitions "tail" recursive is that, in the recursive case,
the result is simply an application of the function being defined (with no
other operators having to be applied thereafter).  Thus, when evaluating
the function at a given value, the recursive "call" is the very last thing
you do (i.e., the tail).  Compare this to, say, the standard (non-tail)
recursive definition of the factorial function:

<font size="+1">
<pre>Fact.n = { 1               if n=0
         { n &times; Fact.(n-1)  otherwise (i.e., n>0) </pre>
</font>

</p><p>
In evaluating Fact.k (for any k&gt;0), we would (recursively) evaluate
Fact.(k-1) <b>and then</b> multiply the result by k.

</p><p>
Exploring the function H described above, we find that

<font size="+1">
<pre>
H.x = H.(g.x)           (assuming &not;b.x)
    = H.(g.(g.x))       (assuming &not;b.(g.x))
    = H.(g.(g.(g.x)))   (assuming &not;b.(g.(g.x)))
    = ...               ...
    = H.(g<sup>[k]</sup>.x)         (assuming &not;b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.x) for all i satisfying 0&le;i&lt;k)
    = f.(g<sup>[k]</sup>.x)         (assuming b.(g<sup>[k]</sup>.x))
</pre>
</font>
where by <tt>g<sup>[k]</sup>.x</tt> we mean <tt>g.(g.(....(g.x)....))</tt>, 
where <tt>g</tt> occurs <tt>k</tt> times.
(Formally, we define <tt>g<sup>[0]</sup>.x = x</tt> and, for <tt>j&ge;0</tt>,
<tt>g<sup>[j+1]</sup>.x = g(g<sup>[j]</sup>.x)</tt>.)
In other words, assuming that there exists some <tt>i&ge;0</tt> for which
<tt>b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.x)</tt> holds, we find that 

<font size="+1">
</p><p><center><tt>H.x = f.(g<sup>[K]</sup>.x)</tt><br></center>
</font>
</p><p>
where <tt>K</tt> is the minimum such <tt>i</tt>.  That is,
 <tt>K = (min i | 0&le;i &and; b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.x) : i)</tt>.

</p><p>
This suggests the following iterative program for establishing y = H.X.

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<font size="+1">
<pre><code>|[con X : S;
  con K : int;  { K = (MIN i | 0&le;i &and; b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.X) : i) }
  var x : S;
  var k : int;
  var y : T;
  x,k := X,0;
  { loop invariant I : x = g<sup>[k]</sup>.X  &and;  0&le;k&le;K }
  { bound function t : K - k }
  do k &ne; K &rarr;  x,k := g.x, k+1
  od
  { assertion: x = g<sup>[k]</sup>.X  &and;  k=K; hence, H.X = f.x }
  y := f.x;
  { y = H.X }
]| </code></pre>
</font>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
The code above suffers from the fact that it relies upon "knowing"
(magically, apparently) the value of <tt>K</tt>.  From the loop invariant
(and our definition of <tt>K</tt>) it follows that the loop guard is
equivalent to <tt>&not;b.x</tt>.  By using this as our guard,
we remove the program's dependence upon <tt>K</tt>.

</p><p>
Further observation of the code reveals that, except insofar as the
loop invariant refers to it, the variable <tt>k</tt> is useless.
It is worth investigating, then, whether we can restate the invariant
so as not to mention <tt>k</tt>.  It turns out that, indeed, we can,
by observing that, as <tt>x</tt> assumes the values 
</p><p><center><tt> 
X, g.X, g<sup>[2]</sup>.X, g<sup>[3]</sup>.X, ...</tt></center>

</p><p>
on successive iterations of the loop, the property <tt>H.x = H.X</tt> 
is preserved.  Hence, we can state the loop invariant as 
<tt>I : H.x = H.X</tt> and we can omit the variable <tt>k</tt> from the
program altogether.
Let us prove that this <tt>I</tt> is, indeed, a loop invariant.  To
do so, it suffices to prove that the truth of <tt>I</tt> is established by the
initialization code and that its truth is preserved by an arbitrary iteration
of the loop.  (These correspond to proof obligations (i) and (ii) in the loop
checklist.)  That <tt>I</tt> is established by the initialization is obvious
(a proof of <tt>{true} x:=X {H.x = H.X}</tt> is left to the reader);
that <tt>I</tt> is preserved by each loop iteration is proved by showing the
Hoare triple

</p><p><center><tt>{I &and; &not;b.x} x := g.x {I}</tt></center>
</p><p>
which is equivalent to 

</p><p><center><tt>[I &and; &not;b.x ==&gt; wp.(x := g.x).I]</tt></center>
</p><p>
Here is the proof:

<pre>
 Assume I (i.e., H.x = H.X) and &not;b.x

    wp.(x := g.x).I

 =    < wp assignment law >

    I(x := g.x)

 =    < defn of I >

    (H.x = H.X)(x := g.x)
    
 =    < textual sub >

    H.(g.x) = H.X

 =    < assumption &not;b.x; by defn. of H, &not;b.x implies H.x = H.(g.x) >

    H.x = H.X

 =    < assumption >

    true
</pre>

</p><p>
Unfortunately, the bound function still refers not only to <tt>k</tt>
but also to <tt>K</tt>.  Although it is not as elegant as the original,
the bound function can be described as
</p><p><center><tt>
t : (MIN i | 0<=i &and; b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.x) : i)</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
In other words, <tt>t</tt> is the number of (additional) times that 
<tt>g</tt> must be applied to <tt>x</tt> in order for the result to 
satisfy <tt>b</tt>.
Of course, whether or not such a number exists depends upon 
<tt>g</tt>, <tt>b</tt>, and <tt>x</tt>.  In the typical case,
<tt>x</tt> will be an integer, <tt>b</tt> will be true when <tt>x</tt>
is sufficiently close to zero, and <tt>g.x</tt> will be a number
closer to zero than is <tt>x</tt>.

</p><p>
The final version of the program is as follows:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<font size="+1">
<pre><code>|[con X : S;
  var x : S;
  var y : T;
  x := X;
  { loop invariant I : H.x = H.X }
  { bound function t : (MIN i | 0<=i &and; b.(g<sup>[i]</sup>.x) : i) }
  do &not;b.x &rarr;  x := g.x
  od;
  { assertion: H.x = H.X &nbsp;&and;&nbsp; b.x ; hence, H.X = f.x }  
  y := f.x;
  { y = H.X }
]| </code></pre></font>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
As a concrete example of a tail recursive function definition, we offer this:
<font size="+1">
<pre>H.n = { n        if 0&le;n&le;1
      { H.(n-2)  otherwise (i.e., n>1) </pre>
</font>

<p>
It should not take you long to recognize that this function, when applied
to a natural number <em>n</em>, yields zero if <em>n</em> is even and
one if <em>n</em> is odd.

<p>
In general, however, "natural" examples of tail recursive function
definitions are not often encountered.
<!--
We offer here no concrete examples of tail recursive functions for the simple
reason that "natural" examples are hard to come by!
-->

</p><p>
<hr>
<H3>Pseudo-tail recursive functions:</H3>

Few "natural" recursive function definitions (i.e., ones that someone is
likely to devise via intuition in formally defining a function) are tail
recursive.  However, some non-tail recursive function definitions can be
transformed to obtain a tail recursive definition of a function having
one extra argument and in terms of which the original function can be defined
directly.  In particular, such a transformation can be applied to any
definition having the following "pseudo tail recursive" form:

<font size="+1">
<pre>
G.x = { f.x            if b.x
      { h.x &oplus; G.(g.x)  otherwise (i.e., &not;b.x)
</pre> </font>

where <tt>&oplus; : T &times; T &rarr; T</tt> is an associative operator
having an identity element <tt>e</tt> and where <tt>b</tt>, <tt>f</tt>, 
and <tt>g</tt> are functions as described before.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> 
The right-hand side of the recursive case in the definition of <tt>G</tt> could
have been <tt>G.(g.x) &oplus; h.x</tt> (even if <tt>&oplus;</tt> were not 
commutative/symmetric). 
This would simply mean that, in what follows, the two operands in
every subexpression of the form <tt>a &oplus; b</tt> should be swapped.
<b>End of note</b>.

</p><p>
Examples of pseudo-tail recursive function definitions:

</p><p>
<b>Example 1:</b> the classic factorial function
<pre>
  Fact.n = { 1               if n=0
           { n &times; Fact.(n-1)  otherwise (i.e., n>0)
</pre>

</p><p>
<b>Example 2:</b> a function that calculates the sum of the digits in
  the decimal (base ten) numeral describing a number.
  (In 462, for instance, the sum of the digits is 4+6+2 = 12.)

<pre>
  digit_sum.n = { 0                              if n=0
                { (n mod 10) + digit_sum.(n/10)  otherwise
</pre>

</p><p>
<b>Example 3:</b> a function that reports whether or not a specified
value (x) occurs among the values in the prefix of a specified length
(n) of a specified array (b).  That is, it answers the question,
Does x occur in b[0..n)?
<pre>
  occurs_in.x.b.n = { false                                if n=0
                    { (b.(n-1) = x) &or; occurs_in.x.b.(n-1)  otherwise
</pre>

</p><p>
We now show that, for any function that can be defined via a pseudo-tail
recursive definition, there exists a "more general" function that can be
defined via tail recursion.

</p><p>
Let G be the function defined via the pseudo-tail recursive definition 
template above.  Define H as follows:

</p><p><center><tt>H.x.y = y &oplus; G.x</tt></center>

</p><p>
Notice that H has one "extra" argument, y.  One might call this
the "accumulating argument" in that (something close to) the result
of the function application "accumulates" in it as we go deeper and
deeper into the recursive applications of the function.
This will become evident when we do a concrete example.

</p><p>
Consider the two cases <tt>b.x</tt> and <tt>&not;b.x</tt>:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr>
<td>
<pre>Case b.x:

    H.x.y 

 =    < defn of H >

    y &oplus; G.x

 =    < defn of G; assumption b.x > 

    y &oplus; f.x
</pre>
</td>
<td>
<pre>Case &not;b.x:

    H.x.y 

 =    < defn of H >

    y &oplus; G.x

 =    < defn of G; assumption &not;b.x > 

    y &oplus; (h.x &oplus; G.(g.x))

 =    < associativity of &oplus; >

    (y &oplus; h.x) &oplus; G.(g.x)

 =    < defn of H, with x,y := g.x, y &oplus; h.x >

    H.(g.x).(y &oplus; h.x)
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
</p><p>
What this establishes is that we may characterize H as follows:

<font size="+1">
<pre>
H.x.y = { y &oplus; f.x            if b.x
        { H.(g.x).(y &oplus; h.x)  otherwise (i.e., &not;b.x)
</pre>
</font>

</p><p>
But this has the format of a (two-argument) tail recursive function definition.
Hence, H is tail recursive!

</p><p>
Taken together with the fact that <tt>G.x = e &oplus; G.x = H.x.e</tt>
(recall that <tt>e</tt> denotes the identity element of <tt>&oplus;</tt>),
we have that <tt>G</tt> is directly definable in terms of a tail recursive
function.

<h4>A Concrete Example</h4>
</p><p>
Let us carry out this transformation on a concrete example.
Take the function <tt>digit_sum</tt> defined above:

<pre>
  digit_sum.n = { 0                              if n=0
                { (n mod 10) + digit_sum.(n/10)  otherwise
</pre>

</p><p>
In accord with the procedure suggested above, we define

</p><p><center><tt>digit_sum'.n.m = m + digit_sum.n</tt></center>

</p><p>
from which we derive (in a manner analogous to our analysis of H above) that

<pre>
  digit_sum'.n.m = { m + 0                               if n=0
                   { digit_sum'.(n/10).(m + (n mod 10))  otherwise
</pre>
(Of course, we can omit the "<tt>+ 0</tt>" in the base case.)

</p><p>
Using this characterization of <tt>digit_sum'</tt> together with the
fact that <tt>digit_sum.n = digit_sum'.n.0</tt>, we carry through a
particular application of <tt>digit_sum</tt>:

<pre>
  digit_sum.462

=    < digit_sum.n = digit_sum'.n.0 for all n >
 
  digit_sum'.462.0

=    < defn of digit_sum', recursive case >

  digit_sum'.46.(0+2)

=    < defn of digit_sum', recursive case >

  digit_sum'.4.(0+2+6)

=    < defn of digit_sum', recursive case >

  digit_sum'.0.(0+2+6+4)

=    < defn of digit_sum', base case >

  0+2+6+4

=    < arithmetic >

  12
</pre>

</p><p>
This illustrates the idea that the "extra" argument that was introduced
in transforming pseudo-tail recursive <tt>digit_sum</tt> into
(fully-)tail recursive <tt>digit_sum'</tt> serves to accumulate the result.

</p></p>
<b>End of Concrete Example</b>

</p><p>
Let's now return to our generic function G (having a pseudo-tail recursive
definition) and the function H (with the (fully) tail recursive definition)
satisfying G.x = H.x.e, for all x in G's domain (and where e is the identity
of <tt>&oplus;</tt>).
Suppose that we wish to develop a program that, given input <tt>X</tt>,
establishes <tt>z = G.X</tt>.
Then, because <tt>G.X = H.X.e</tt>, it suffices to construct a
program that establishes the equivalent <tt>z = H.X.e</tt>.
Such a program would be as follows:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<font size="+1">
<pre><code>|[con X : S;
  var x : S;
  var y,z : T;
  x,y := X,e;
  { loop invariant I : H.x.y = H.X.e (equivalently, y &oplus; G.x = G.X) }
  do &not;b.x &rarr;  x,y := g.x, y &oplus; h.x;
  od
  { assertion: (H.x.y = H.X.e) &and; b.x; hence H.X.e = y &oplus; f.x }  
  { equivalently: (y &oplus; G.x = G.X) &and; b.x; hence y &oplus; f.x = G.X }
  z := y &oplus; f.x;
  { z = H.X.e; hence, z = G.X }
]| </code></pre></font>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Returning to our concrete example pertaining to the functions
<tt>digit_sum</tt> and <tt>digit_sum'</tt>, the above translates
into this program:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>|[con N : nat;
  var n : nat;
  var m : nat;
  var z : nat;
  n,m := N,0;
  { loop invariant I : digit_sum'.n.m = digit_sum'.N.0 }
  { equivalently: m + digit_sum.n = digit_sum.N }
  do n &ne; 0 &rarr;  n,m := n/10, m + (n mod 10);
  od
  { assertion: digit_sum'.n.m = digit_sum'.N.0  &and;  n=0;
    hence, digit_sum'.N.0 = m + 0 (= m) }  
  { equivalently: m + digit_sum.n = digit_sum.N &and; n=0; hence, m+0 = digit_sum.N }  
  z := m + 0;  // obviously, the "+ 0" can be omitted
  { z = digit_sum'.N.0 }; 
  { equivalently: z = digit_sum.N }
]|  
</code></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<H3>Tail-recursive function definitions with more than two cases</H3>

Suppose that we have the following function definition:

<pre>
H.x = { f<sub>0</sub>.x      if b<sub>0</sub>.x
      { f<sub>1</sub>.x      if b<sub>1</sub>.x
      { H.(g<sub>0</sub>.x)  if c<sub>0</sub>.x
      { H.(g<sub>1</sub>.x)  if c<sub>1</sub>.x
</pre>
where <tt>[b<sub>0</sub>.x &or; b<sub>1</sub>.x &or; c<sub>0</sub>.x &or;
c<sub>1</sub>.x]</tt> (i.e., for every <tt>x</tt>, at least one of
<tt>b<sub>0</sub></tt>, <tt>b<sub>1</sub></tt>, <tt>c<sub>0</sub></tt>, 
or <tt>c<sub>1</sub></tt> holds).
 
<p>
This particular example has exactly two base cases and two recursive
cases, but it can be easily generalized to any number of each.  Strictly
speaking, this does not qualify as a tail recursive definition.  However,
it can be shown that such a definition can be transformed into an equivalent
one that <em>is</em> tail recursive.
(Exactly how this is accomplished is beyond the scope of this document.)
What is important to us is how to transform a function definition such as
this into a program that computes the defined function.  Well, here it is:

<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
