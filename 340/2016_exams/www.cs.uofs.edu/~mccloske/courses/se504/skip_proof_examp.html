Proving Correctness of a skip-program
</H2>

<p>
The Hoare Triple law for skip says
<p><center>
                {P} skip {Q}  &equiv;  [P <tt>&rArr;</tt> Q]
</center>
<p>
Thus, to show {P} skip {Q}, it suffices to complete a proof of 
P <tt>&rArr;</tt> Q.

<p>
Example: Prove { x > y } skip { x &ge; y  &or;  z < y }.
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> Taking P to be x &gt; y and Q to be x &ge; y &or; z &lt; y,
it suffices (by the Hoare Triple law for skip) to complete a proof of 
P <tt>&rArr;</tt> Q:
<pre>  Assume P (i.e., x > y).

     Q

  =     < defn of Q >

     x &ge; y  &or;  z < y

  =     < defn of &ge;  >

     (x > y &or; x=y)  &or;  z < y

  =     < assumption P (i.e., x > y) >

     (true &or; x=y)  &or;  z < y

  =     < symmetry of &or; (Gries 3.24) >

     (x=y &or; true)  &or;  z < y

  =     < zero of &or; (Gries 3.29) >

     true  &or;  z < y

  =     < symmetry of &or; (Gries 3.24) >

     z < y  &or;  true

  =     < zero of &or; (Gries 3.29) >

     true
</pre>
<p>
Our proof was given in quite gory detail.  Usually, we can omit explicit
mention of the use of (Gries 3.24), for example.  Also, we could have
appealed to the assumption <tt>x&gt;y</tt> as a justification for
replacing (the weaker) <tt>x&ge;y</tt> by <tt>true</tt> directly,
without first rewriting the latter as <tt>x&gt;y &or; x=y</tt> and
then using the assumption.  A more concise proof would have been:
<pre>  Assume P (i.e., x > y).

     Q

  =     < defn of Q >

     x &ge; y  &or;  z < y

  =     < assumption P (i.e., x > y) implies x &ge; y >

     true &or; z < y

  =     < zero of &or; (Gries 3.29) >

     true </pre>
<hr>
<p>
Now suppose that we use the wp-approach instead of the Hoare Triple approach.
The relationship between wp and Hoare Triples is
<p><center>
                {P} S {Q} &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;  [P <tt>&rArr;</tt> wp.S.Q]
</center>
<p>
Hence, to prove {P} skip {Q} we show the equivalent
[P <tt>&rArr;</tt> wp.skip.Q].
The usual approach is to assume the antecedant and to show the consequent:
<pre>  Assume P (i.e., x > y).

     wp.skip.Q

  =     < defn of Q >

     wp.skip.(x &ge; y  &or;  z < y)

  =     < wp skip rule, which says [wp.skip.Q &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; Q] >

     x &ge; y  &or;  z < y </pre>     
<p>
As we have arrived at the second line of the proof above, we simply continue
as we did there.
