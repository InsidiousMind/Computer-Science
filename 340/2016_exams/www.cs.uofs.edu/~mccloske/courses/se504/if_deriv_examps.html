<h2>SE 504 &nbsp; Two Examples of Deriving Selection Commands</h2>

<h3>Computing the Maximum</h3>
<p>
Consider this Hoare Triple, where <tt>E</tt> is an unknown expression:
</p><p><center><tt>{true} z := E {z = x max y}</tt></center>

</p><p>
We shall assume that our programming language has no <b>max</b> operator,
or else we would choose E to be <tt><b>x max y</b></tt>, 
making the solution trivial.

</p><p>
As there seems to be no other avenue to pursue, let's make use of the
definition of <b>max</b> in order to rewrite the postcondition.

</p><p>
<b>Definition</b>: <tt>(c = a max b)  &equiv;
                      ((c=a &or; c=b) &and; c&ge;a &and; c&ge;b)</tt>

</p><p>
Restating the postcondition after applying this definition, our Hoare Triple
becomes
</p><p><center><tt>
{true} z := E {(z=x &or; z=y) &and; z&ge;x &and; z&ge;y}
</tt></center>

<!--
  </p><p>
  By distributivity of conjunction over disjunction, we can write the
  postcondition as  (z=x & z>=x & z>=y) v (z=y & z>=x & z>=y).
-->

</p><p>
The postcondition, call it <tt>Q</tt>, suggests (due to its including
as subexpressions <tt><b>z=x</b></tt> and <tt><b>z=y</b></tt>) 
two possible solutions, namely <tt><b>E:x</b></tt> and 
<tt><b>E:y</b></tt>.
Recognizing that neither solution works in all circumstances, we
attempt to calculate, for each one, a predicate characterizing those
circumstances in which it <em>does</em> work.
That is, we seek predicates <tt>P1</tt> and <tt>P2</tt>
truthifying the Hoare Triples 
</p><p><center>
<tt>{P1} z:=x {Q}</tt> &nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>{P2} z:=y {Q}</tt>. 
</center>

</p><p>
Calculation (using the wp assignment law) reveals that the
weakest solution for <tt>P1</tt> is <tt>x&ge;y</tt> and the
weakest solution for <tt>P2</tt> is <tt>y&ge;x</tt>.
(See Appendix 1 for details.)
That is, we have established
</p><p><center>
<tt>{x &ge; y} z := x {Q}</tt>  &nbsp;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<tt>{y &ge; x} z := y {Q}</tt>
</center>

</p><p>
Embedding them in a selection command (with guards to be determined),
we obtain
<pre>
      {true}
      if B0  --->  {x&ge;y} z:=x {Q}
      [] B1  --->  {y&ge;x} z:=y {Q}
      fi
      {Q}
</pre>
</p><p>
Recall that, in proving the correctness of a selection command, for each
of its guarded commands <b><tt>Bi ---> Si</tt></b> we must prove 
</p><p><center>
  <b><tt>{P &and; Bi} Si {Q}</tt></b>
</center>
</p><p>
where <b><tt>P</tt></b> and <b><tt>Q</tt></b> are the pre- and postconditions,
respectively, of the selection command.

</p><p>
In our example, <b><tt>P &and; B0</tt></b> is <b><tt>x&ge;y</tt></b> and
<b><tt>P</tt></b> is <b><tt>true</tt></b>, which leads us to choose
<b><tt>B0</tt></b> to be <b><tt>x&ge;y</tt></b>.
By similar reasoning, we choose 
<b><tt>B1</tt></b> to be <b><tt>y&ge;x</tt></b>, and we obtain
<pre>
      {true}
      if x&ge;y  --->  {x&ge;y} z:=x {Q}
      [] y&ge;x  --->  {y&ge;x} z:=y {Q}
      fi
      {Q}
</pre>

</p><p>
All that remains (in order to prove the correctness of this selection command)
is to verify that, in every state, at least one of the two guards is true.
But this is obvious!  (For a rigorous proof, see Appendix 2.)

<h3>Squaring x while Preserving the value of x<sup>y</sup><tt>&sdot;</tt>z</h3>

<p>
Consider the Hoare Triple
</p><p><center><tt>
          {P &and; y&gt;0} x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>, E, F {P}
</tt></center>
</p><p>
<!-- where <tt>x<sup>2</sup></tt> is an abbreviation for <tt>x*x</tt> and -->
where <tt>P: C = x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z</tt>, <tt>E</tt> and <tt>F</tt> are
unknown expressions, and all variables are of type <tt>int</tt>.

</p><p>
Let us try to calculate E and F.
Following the usual approach, we attempt to carry out a
proof of <tt> P &and; y&gt;0 &rArr; wp.(x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>,E,F).P </tt>,
along the way choosing appropriate expressions for E and F.
<pre>
   Assume P &and; y&gt;0 (where P : C = x<sup>y</sup> &sdot; z)

   wp.(x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>,E,F).P

 =    < wp assignment law, defn of P, text. sub. >

   C = (x<sup>2</sup>)<sup>E</sup>&sdot;F

 =    < algebra: (a<sup>b</sup>)<sup>c</sup> = a<sup>bc</sup> >

   C = x<sup>2E</sup>&sdot;F

 =    < assumption C = x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z >

   x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2E</sup>&sdot;F
</pre>

</p><p>
At this point, we recognize that if we choose expressions for E and F that
satisfy y = 2E and F = z, we have a solution.  In the case that y/2 is an
integer (i.e., isEven.y), this is possible, as then we can choose E to be
<b><tt>y div 2</tt></b> and F to be <b><tt>z</tt></b>.
(Note that the expression that we choose for E must be of type <tt>int</tt>,
which means that we need to use <b><tt>div</tt></b> rather than
<b><tt>/</tt></b>, as the latter yields a result of type <tt>real</tt>.)
</p><p>
That is, had we assumed, in addition to <tt>P &and; y>0</tt>, that
<tt>isEven.y</tt>, we could have continued the proof as follows:
<pre>
   x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2E</sup>&sdot;F

 =    < choose E : y div 2  and  F : z >

   x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2(y div 2)</sup>&sdot;z

 =    < y div 2 = y/2 is equivalent to the assumption isEven.y >

   x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2(y/2)</sup>&sdot;z

 =    < theorem: 2(a/2) = a >

   x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z

 =    < reflexivity of = >

   true
</pre>
</p><p>
One of our steps made use of the theorem 
<tt>isEven.a &nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp; a div 2 = a/2</tt>,
which relates integer division by 2 with real division by 2
in the case of the dividend being even.

</p><p>
What we have just shown is
</p><p><center><tt>
P &and; y>0 &and; isEven.y &nbsp;&rArr;&nbsp; 
wp.(x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>,y div 2,z).P
</tt></center>
</p><p>
which, of course, is equivalent to the Hoare Triple
<tt>{P &and; y>0 &and; isEven.y} x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>,y div 2,z {P}</tt>

</p><p>
Now consider the case &not;isEven.y. 
The relevant theorem relating integer division by 2 and
real division by 2 when the dividend is positive but not even is this:
</p><p><center><tt>
a&gt;0 &and; &not;isEven.a
&nbsp;&nbsp;&equiv;&nbsp;&nbsp; a div 2 = (a-1)/2
</tt></center>
</p><p>
Let's explore the possibility that, in this case too, there
exists a solution in which E is <tt>y div 2</tt>.
Continuing from where we had left off (and taking <tt>&not;isEven.y</tt>
as an "extra" assumption), we get
<pre>
     x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2E</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < choose E to be y div 2 >

     x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2(y div 2)</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < y div 2 = (y-1)/2  is equivalent to assumption &not;isEven.y &and; y>0 >

     x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>2((y-1)/2)</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < algebra: 2(a/2) = a >

     x<sup>y</sup>&sdot;z = x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < algebra: If k>0, a<sup>k</sup> = a<sup>k-1</sup>&sdot;a >

     (x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;x)&sdot;z = x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < associativity of &sdot; >

     x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;(x&sdot;z) = x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;F

 =     < choose F : x&sdot;z >

     x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;(x&sdot;z) = x<sup>y-1</sup>&sdot;(x&sdot;z)

 =     < reflexivity of = >

     true
</pre>
</p><p>
What we have just proved is the Hoare Triple
</p><p><center><tt>
  {P &and; y>0 &and; &not;isEven.y} x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>,y div 2,x&sdot;z {P}
</tt></center>

</p><p>
Summarizing, what we've found is that, if y is even, choosing <tt>y div 2</tt>
for E and <tt>z</tt> for F yields a solution, while if y is not even,
choosing <tt>y div 2</tt> for E and <tt>x&sdot;z</tt> for F yields a solution.
This leads us to replace the assignment command in our original Hoare Triple
with a selection command, as follows:

<pre>
  {P &and; y>0}
  if isEven.y  ---> {P &and; y>0 &and; isEven.y} x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2, z {P}
  [] &not;isEven.y ---> {P &and; y>0 & &not;isEven.y} x,y,z := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2, x&sdot;z {P}
  fi
  {P}
</pre>
<!--
</p><p>
Each guard was chosen so that conjuncting it with the precondition (of the
selection command) yielded the precondition of the corresponding guarded
command (within the selection command).
-->

</p><p>
Our obligation of showing that the precondition implies the disjunction
of the guards is trivial, since the two guards are negations of each
other.

</p><p>
The above is a perfectly good solution.  However, a finicky programmer,
observing that the assignments to <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> in the
two branches are identical, may feel the urge to "factor out" that
common part, putting it in a separate assignment command and leaving
only the assignments to <tt>z</tt> within the selection command.
Given that the values assigned to <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> don't depend 
upon <tt>z</tt>, but that the guards of the selection command depend upon
<tt>y</tt> and the assignment in one branch of the selection depends upon
<tt>x</tt>, the only sensible ordering of commands is to put the selection
command first, followed by the (simultaneous) assignment to <tt>x</tt> and
<tt>y</tt>.  We get this program:
<pre>
  {P &and; y>0}
  if isEven.y  ---> {P &and; y>0 &and; isEven.y} z := z {R}
  [] &not;isEven.y ---> {P &and; y>0 &and; &not;isEven.y} z := x&sdot;z {R}
  fi
  {R}
  ;x,y := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2;
  {P}
</pre>

</p><p>
Of course, <tt>P</tt> is no longer a proper postcondition for the
selection command, as its execution cannot possibly change the values
of either <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt>, but may change the value of <tt>z</tt>,
which would result in a state in which <tt>P</tt> is false.
So then what is the appropriate choice for <tt>R</tt>?

</p><p>
But of course, <tt>R</tt> should be 
<tt>wp.(x,y := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2).P</tt>, which is
<tt>P(x,y := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2)</tt>, or, if you prefer
(after a little algebra on the exponents)
</p><p><center><tt>C = x<sup>2(y div 2)</sup>&sdot;z</tt></center>

</p><p>
Recognizing that the assignment <tt>z := z</tt> is silly, we replace it
with the equivalent <tt>skip</tt>.  We get the annotated program

<pre>
  {P &and; y>0}
  if isEven.y  ---> {P &and; y>0 &and; isEven.y} skip {P(x,y:=x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2)}
  [] &not;isEven.y ---> {P &and; y>0 &and; &not;isEven.y} z := x&sdot;z {P(x,y:=x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2)}
  fi
  {P(x,y:=x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2)}
  ;x,y := x<sup>2</sup>, y div 2;
  {P}
</pre>

</p><p>
To verify that our (intuition-based) transformation of the program is
correct, we need only prove each of the two Hoare Triples nested inside
the selection command, which is easy and is left to the reader.

<hr>
<h3>Appendix 1</h3>
<p>
Here we calculate <b><tt>wp.(z:=x).Q</tt></b> &mdash;which, of course, is
the weakest solution to <b><tt>Y : {Y} z := x {Q}</tt></b>&mdash;
where <b><tt>Q : (z=x &or; z=y) &and; z&ge;x &and; z&ge;y</tt></b>.
The calculation of <b><tt>wp.(z:=y).Q</tt></b> is analogous.
<pre>
   wp.(z:=x).Q

=    < defn of Q >

   wp.(z:=x).((z=x &or; z=y) &and; z&ge;x &and; z&ge;y)

=    < wp assignment law >

   ((z=x &or; z=y) &and; z&ge;x &and; z&ge;y)(z:=x)

=    < textual substitution >

   (x=x &or; x=y) &and; x&ge;x &and; x&ge;y

=    < both = and &ge; are reflexive >

   (true &or; x=y) &and; true &and; x&ge;y

=    < true is the "zero" of &or; > and the identity of &and; (twice) >

   true &and; true &and; x&ge;y

=    < (3.39), true is identity of &and; >

   x&ge;y
</pre>

<hr>
<h3>Appendix 2</h3>
<p>
We accept as a theorem of number theory the following:
</p><p>
<b>Theorem:</b> For all real numbers <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>,
<em>x&gt;y</em> &nbsp;&or;&nbsp; <em>y&gt;x</em> &nbsp;&or;&nbsp; <em>x=y</em>

</p><p>
Now we prove that <tt>x&ge;y &or; y&ge;x</tt>:
<pre>
   x&ge;y &or; y&ge;x

=    < defn of &ge; >

   (x&gt;y &or; x=y) &or; (y&gt;x &or; y=x)

=    < symmetry of =; associativity, symmetry, and idempotence of &or; >

   x&gt;y &or; y&gt;x &or; x=y    ------Theorem above
