Development of a <em>Counter</em> Class Hierarchy
</H2>

<p>
Suppose that you want to develop a class to model the behavior of a
<em>counter</em>, i.e., an object with an integer value that you can
increment, decrement, or set to a desired value.
You might produce something like the following:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="1">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>public class Counter {

   /*   i n s t a n c e  v a r i a b l e s   */

   private int cntrVal;  // current value of the counter


   /*   c o n s t r u c t o r s   */

   /** pre:  true
   *   post: this.countVal() == init
   */
   public Counter(int init) { cntrVal = init; }

   /** pre:  true
   *   post: this.countVal() == 0
   */
   public Counter() { this(0); }


   /*  o b s e r v e r s   */

   public int countVal() { return cntrVal; }


   /*   m u t a t o r s   */

   /** pre:  let c == this.countVal()
   *   post: this.countVal() == c + 1
   */
   public void increment() { cntrVal = cntrVal + 1; }


   /** pre:  let c == this.countVal()
   *   post: this.countVal() == c - 1
   */
   public void decrement() { cntrVal = cntrVal - 1; }


   /* pre:  true
   *  post: this.countVal() == newVal
   */
   public void setTo(int newVal) { cntrVal = newVal; }
}</code></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Suppose that, after the class <em>Counter</em> has "gone into production"
(and hence, by your company's rules, may not be modified), a need arises
for a "reset-able" counter, i.e., one having a <tt>reset</tt> operation
by which it can be made to return to its original value.
We could develop a new class for this, making use of <em>Counter</em>
as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="1">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>public class ResetableCounterViaComposition {

   /*   i n s t a n c e  v a r i a b l e s   */

   private Counter c;   
   private int initVal;


   /*   c o n s t r u c t o r s   */

   public ResetableCounterViaComposition(int initCntrVal)) {
      initVal = initCntrVal;
      c = new Counter(initCntrVal);
   }

   public ResetableCounterViaComposition() { this(0); }


   /*  o b s e r v e r s   */

   public int countVal() { return c.countVal(); }


   /*   m u t a t o r s   */

   public void increment() { c.increment(); }
   public void decrement() { c.decrement(); }
   public void setTo(int newVal) { c.setTo(newVal); }
   <b>public void reset() { c.setTo(initVal); }</b>
}</code></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Notice that each instance of <em>ResetableCounterViaComposition</em> contains,
as one of its fields, a reference to an instance of <em>Counter</em>.
When an instance of a class <em>A</em> has as fields (references to)
instances of classes <em>A<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>A<sub>2</sub></em>, ...,
<em>A<sub>k</sub></em>, we say that <em>A</em> is built via
<b>composition</b> from <em>A<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>A<sub>2</sub></em>,
..., <em>A<sub>k</sub></em>.  The use of composition indicates that
there is a <b>has-a</b> relationship between, in this case, instances
of <em>A</em> and instances of each of the <em>A<sub>i</sub></em>'s.

<p>
To illustrate what's going on, suppose that an instance of
<em>ResetableCounterViaComposition</em> currently has value <em>7</em>
(i.e., is in a state such that an invocation of <tt>countVal()</tt>
yields <em>7</em>) and had <em>0</em> as its initial value.
Then the situation is as depicted below, in which
there is an instance of <em>ResetableCounterViaComposition</em> (on the left)
whose <tt>initVal</tt> field contains zero and whose <tt>c</tt> field
contains a reference to an instance of <em>Counter</em> (on the right)
whose <tt>cntrVal</tt> field has value <em>7</em>:

<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>
     +-----------------+
     |         +---+   |
     | initVal | 0 |   |              +------------------+
     |         +---+   |              |          +---+   |
     |       c | *-|---+------------->|  cntrVal | 7 |   |
     |         +---+   |              |          +---+   |
     +-----------------+              +------------------+
        instance of                        instance of
ResetableCounterViaComposition               Counter
</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
With the exception of <tt>reset()</tt>, every method in
<em>ResetableCounterViaComposition</em> is implemented by
invoking the corresponding method on its instance variable <tt>c</tt>.
Thus, even though each such method is "trivial" to implement, the
fact remains that we have to supply the code for it.

</p><p>
If, instead of viewing a reset-able counter as an object that 
contains a (plain) counter object as one of its components, 
we view it as a <em>special kind</em> of counter object, we
obtain a more elegant result.
The idea of an object of a class <em>B</em> being a special kind of object
of another class <em>A</em> is supported in Java (and other object-oriented
languages) by the mechanism of <b>inheritance</b>, or <b>subclassing</b>,
or <b>extension</b>.
Here we would define <em>B</em> to <b>inherit from</b> (or be a
<b>subclass of</b>, or <b>extend</b>) <em>A</em>.
Using this mechanism, we extend <em>Counter</em> to arrive at a
subclass modeling a reset-able counter:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2" cellpadding="1">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>public class ResetableCounter extends Counter {

   /*   i n s t a n c e  v a r i a b l e s   */

   private int initVal;   // initial value


   /*   c o n s t r u c t o r s   */

   public ResetableCounter(int initCntrVal) {
      super(initCntrVal);     // calls constructor of the superclass
      initVal = initCntrVal;
   }

   public ResetableCounter() { this(0); }  // call to other constructor 


   /*   n e w   m u t a t o r s   */

   public void reset() { setTo(initVal); }
}</code></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
When a class <em>B</em> is built by extending a class <em>A</em>, we
say that <em>B</em> is a <b>subclass</b> of <em>A</em> or, equivalently,
that <em>A</em> is a <b>superclass</b> of <em>B</em>.
(We also say that <em>B</em> is derived from <em>A</em> via
extension.)
More concretely, what this means is that each instance of <em>B</em> 
has all the fields (and methods) that an instance of <em>A</em> has, 
plus whatever fields (and methods) are declared in <em>B</em>.
<!-- , and that the methods applicable
    to instances of <em>B</em> include all those applicable to instances
    of <em>A</em>, plus whatever (public) methods are declared in <em>A</em>.
-->
We say that instances of <em>B</em> <b>inherit</b> the attributes/features
(i.e., fields and methods) of class <em>A</em>.  In particular, no mention
needs to be made inside <em>B</em> of the attributes it inherits from
<em>A</em>.

</p><p>
As an aside, we note that there are rules governing the accessibility of
inherited attributes.  For example, an instance variable (or method)
declared to be <tt><b>private</b></tt> in class <em>A</em> cannot be referred
to inside its child class <em>B</em>.
In case we want an attribute (e.g., instance variable or method) to be
accessible within its subclasses, we would use the access modifier
<tt><b>protected</b></tt> rather than <tt><b>private</b></tt>.
(This also allows access by all the classes in the same package.)

</p><p>
In extending a class <em>A</em> to derive a subclass <em>B</em>,
typically what we do is to introduce instance variables and
methods that do not exist in <em>A</em>.  In our example, 
<em>ResetableCounter</em> introduces an instance variable <tt>initVal</tt>
and a method <tt>reset()</tt>.  (Also, as is typically the case, one or
more constructors are included in a subclass, because among the actions
taken to initialize a new instance of the subclass is to initialize the
values of the newly-introduced instance variables.)

</p><p>
Although there was no need for it in <em>ResetableCounter</em>, a subclass
may <b>override</b> one or more methods of its parent.  If <em>B</em>
is a subclass of <em>A</em>, and <em>B</em> contains a method <tt>f()</tt>
having the same name and signature (number and types of parameters)
as some method in <em>A</em>, we say that
the method <tt>f()</tt> in <em>B</em> overrides the like-named method in
<em>A</em>.  What this means is that, if <tt>b</tt> is (a reference to)
an instance of <em>B</em>, the invocation <tt>b.f()</tt> will be of 
<em>B</em>'s method, not <em>A</em>'s.

</p><p>
Let us explore the issues of inheritance further by supposing that 
a need arises for a counter having specified minimum and
maximum values and the property that its value "rolls over" (like an
old-fashioned mechanical automobile odometer) when it is incremented
beyond its maximum value or decremented beyond its minimum value.

</p><p>
We could use either composition or inheritance to build this class.
Using inheritance makes more sense, however, because the kind of counter
we are describing is just a special case of the kinds of counters
we considered above.

</p><p>
Notice that, within the class <em>RollOverCounter</em>, we have supplied
new versions of the methods <tt>increment()</tt> and <tt>decrement()</tt>,
rather than inheriting those methods from its parent,
<em>ResetableCounter</em> (which itself inherited them from its parent,
<em>Counter</em>).  That is, <em>RolloverCounter</em> overrides its
parent's methods <tt>increment()</tt> and <tt>decrement()</tt>.
Note, however, as this example illustrates, that an overriding
method in a subclass may invoke the method it overrides
by inserting "<tt>super.</tt>" before its name.
It is common for an overridden method to be invoked within the
method that overrides it; this makes sense, because often the overriding
method carries out the same actions as the overridden method, plus 
additional actions.

</p><p>
Now suppose we want a "stopping" counter that is similar to a "rollover"
counter except that, where the latter would have rolled over, the former
doesn't change.  Suppose that we also want a "warning" counter that throws
an exception in the same situations where the other two kinds of counters 
would have rolled over and stopped, respectively.

</p><p>
All three kinds of counters that were just mentioned ---rollover,
stopping, and warning counters--- are similar; hence, rather than
making the three corresponding classes be virtual copies of one another,
we "factor out" their commonality and make an abstract class from which
all three can be derived via extension.  Because what is common about
these three kinds of counters is that their values are bounded from below
and above, we call this new class <em>BoundedCounter</em>:

</p><p>

<pre><code>public <b>abstract</b> class BoundedCounter extends ResetableCounter {

   /*   n e w   i n s t a n c e   v a r i a b l e s   */

</p><p>
Notice that <em>BoundedCounter</em> is declared to be <b>abstract</b>.
This means that no object may be constructed directly from this class.
Here, this makes sense, because even though the class provides its
clients with a means of establishing boundaries upon a counter,
it provides no specific means of enforcing them!  More precisely,
it assumes that a counter whose value is not at its maximum 
(respectively, minimum) allowed value should respond 
"normally" (i.e., as specified in its superclass, <em>ResetableCounter</em>)
when incremented (respectively, decremented), but it yields to its subclasses
the responsibility to define, via the method <tt>incrementFromMax()</tt>
(respectively, <tt>decrementFromMin()</tt>) how a counter should respond
to being incremented (respectively, decremented) when its value
is at the maximum bound (respectively, minimum bound).
This explains the presence of these two abstract methods.

</p><p>
Having defined <em>BoundedCounter</em> as above, the class
<em>RollOverCounter</em> can be simplified to the following:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>public class RollOverCounter extends BoundedCounter {

   /*   c o n s t r u c t o r s   */

   public RollOverCounter(int init, int min, int max) 
      { super(init, min, max); }

   public RollOverCounter(int min, int max) { super(min, max); }

   public RollOverCounter() { super(); }


   /* concrete definitions for abstract methods in superclass */

   protected void incrementFromMax() { setTo(minimumVal()); }

   protected void decrementFromMin() { setTo(maximumVal()); }

}</code></pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
We leave as an exercise the problem of developing the classes
<em>StoppingCounter</em> and <em>WarningCounter</em>.

<hr>
</p><p>
To illustrate the concept of <b>polymorphism</b>, consider the following
(rather contrived) method, which, given a String object and a Counter
object, scans the characters in the former, invoking the latter's
<tt>increment()</tt> method each time a space is encountered.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2">
<tr><td>
<pre>public static void countSpaces(String str, Counter counter) {
   for (int i=0; i!= str.length(); i++) {
      if (str.charAt(i) == ' ') { 
         counter.increment();
      }
   }
} </pre> 
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Now consider executing the following code.  The embedded comments describe
what the effects would be.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="2">
<tr><td>
<pre>
   String s = "The cat in the hat ate a rat."; 

   Counter cntr1 = new Counter(0);
   countSpaces(s, cntr1);
   System.out.println("cntr1 says " + cntr1.countVal());
   // Result printed should be 7.

   Counter cntr2 = new RollOverCounter(0,0,4);
   countSpaces(s, cntr2);
   System.out.println("cntr2 says " + cntr2.countVal());
   // Result printed should be 2 (The 5th space takes the counter back to
   // zero, because 4 is the counter's upper bound.  The remaining two
   // spaces take the counter back up to two.)

   Counter cntr3 = new StoppingCounter(0,0,4);
   countSpaces(s, cntr3);
   System.out.println("cntr3 says " + cntr3.countVal());
   // Result printed should be 4, as incrementing the counter has no
   // effect once it has reached its upper bound of 4.

   Counter cntr4 = new WarningCounter(0,0,4);
   countSpaces(s, cntr4);
   // Above call would result in an exception being thrown, as on the
   // fifth space an attempt would be made to increment the counter
   // beyond its upper bound of 4.
   System.out.println("cntr4 says " + cntr4.countVal());
