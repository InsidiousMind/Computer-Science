<H3>The Concept</H3>
<p>
In Great Britain, what we in the USA refer to as a waiting line (as in a
bank or grocery store) is usually called a <em>queue</em>.
The person at the front of the queue receives some kind of service and
then departs.  A person entering the queue does so at the rear.
Thus, a queue exhibits a FIFO ("first-in-first-out") arrival/departure
pattern.  Viewing it slightly differently, we can say that a queue is a
sequence of items such that insertions occur at one end (called the
<b>rear</b>) and deletions occur at the other end (called the <b>front</b>).
The insert and delete operations are usually called <tt>enqueue</tt> and 
<tt>dequeue</tt>, respectively (even though a good argument could be
made for referring to them as <tt>insert</tt> and <tt>delete</tt>
in order to maintain uniformity with other kinds of <em>container</em>
data types).
Often, observers of a queue are limited to detecting whether or not it is
empty (or perhaps even its size) and, if not, to seeing the item at the front.

<p>
Queues are analogous to stacks in that there are two observer operations
(one to determine if the queue is empty and the other to examine the item at
the front) and two mutators (one for insertion and one for deletion).

<p>
Here is a Java interface for the queue ADT:

<H3>Applications</H3>
<p>
<b>Use of queues by computer operating systems:</b>
A computer operating system manages the resources available to the
processes running on the machine.  Among these resources are the
processor(s), space (memory), peripheral devices (e.g., printers, disk units).
Often, a process will request a resource that is not currently available
because it is already being used by some other process.
When this happens, the request is recorded and, later, when the
resource becomes available, the request is granted.
Often (but not always), the order in which requests for a particular
resource are granted corresponds to the order in which they were submitted.
One way to achieve this is by associating with each resource a queue in
which the as-yet-ungranted requests for it are stored.


<p>
<b>The uniform-cost single-source shortest paths problem:</b>
A somewhat more interesting application of a queue is in solving
this problem.  You are given as input a directed graph <tt>G</tt>
and one of its vertices, <tt>v</tt>, called the source vertex. 
(For convenience, we assume that the vertices of <tt>G</tt> are
identified by the integers 0 through <tt>N-1</tt>, where <tt>N</tt>
is the number of vertices in <tt>G</tt>.)
The output is an array <tt>dist[0..N-1]</tt>, such that, for each
<tt>z</tt>, <tt>0&lt;=z&lt;N</tt>, <tt>dist[z]</tt> equals <em>d(z)</em>,
i.e., the length of a shortest path from vertex <tt>v</tt> to vertex
<tt>z</tt>.
(If there is no path from <tt>v</tt> to <tt>z</tt>, <tt>dist[z]</tt>
should end up containing, say, <tt>-1</tt>.)
Here, the length of a path is defined to be the number of edges appearing
in it.
(The term "uniform cost" refers to the fact that we assume that 
traversing one edge costs the same as traversing any other.
If edges are allowed to have different costs associated with them,
the problem becomes more difficult to solve.)

<!--
<p>
So, we have a graph <tt>G</tt> and a source vertex <tt>v</tt>.
For any vertex <tt>z</tt>, let <em>d(z)</em> be the length of a
shortest path from <tt>v</tt> to <tt>z</tt>, or <tt>-1</tt> if <tt>z</tt>
is not reachable from <tt>v</tt>.
The goal of the program, then, is to place values into the array
<tt>dist[0..N-1]</tt> in order to establish <tt>dist[z] == </tt><em>d(z)</em>
for all <tt>z</tt>.

<p>
Initially, the only vertex whose <tt>d</tt>-value we know is 
<tt>v</tt> itself: the shortest path from <tt>v</tt> to itself
is the "empty path" of length zero.  Hence, we initialize 
<tt>dist[0..N-1]</tt> by filling it with <tt>-1</tt>'s, except for
<tt>dist[v]</tt>, into which we place zero.
In order to get things started, we place <tt>v</tt> into an otherwise 
empty queue, <tt>q</tt>.  At this point, we consider <tt>v</tt> to
have been <b>discovered</b>.  Indeed, at any point during execution, 
the vertices on the queue are precisely those that have been discovered
but whose edges we have not yet <b>explored</b>.

<p>
Following the initializations, there is a loop that iterates until the
queue has become empty.  The purpose of each iteration is to take a
vertex <tt>x</tt> off the (front of the) queue and to <b>explore</b>
its outgoing edges in order to discover new (i.e., as yet undiscovered)
vertices.  Suppose, for example, that we explore the edge going from
<tt>x</tt> to <tt>y</tt>.  
  If <tt>y</tt> was not previously discovered,
it just has been!  Postponing for now the issue of how to tell whether a
given vertex <tt>y</tt> was previously discovered, consider what 
actions
ought to be taken upon discovering <tt>y</tt>.  Well, 

<p>
Having discovered <tt>y</tt> by virtue of exploring from <tt>x</tt>, 
we know that there is a path to <tt>y</tt> of length one more than 
the length of a shortest path to <tt>x</tt>.  Hence, we fill 
<tt>dist[y]</tt> with <tt>dist[x] + 1</tt>.
In order to ensure that <tt>y</tt> will be explored
We also place <tt>y</tt> into the queue so that it will be explored from later).


<p>
The key to why this works is that

The following is a Java method that solves the problem.
Given a digraph and a "source" vertex <tt>v</tt> within that graph, it
returns an array of <tt>int</tt>'s indicating each vertex's distance
from <tt>v</tt>.
The method assumes the existence of a class <tt>DiGraph</tt> having the
instance methods that it invokes.
The class <tt>QueueX</tt> can be any class that implements the <tt>Queue</tt>
interface shown above.

<p>
The main concepts underlying the algorithm are those of
<em>exploring from</em> a vertex and <em>discovering</em> a vertex.
In doing the former, we sometimes achieve the latter.
To explore a vertex, we examine its outgoing edges. 
If the edge being examined goes to an undiscovered vertex,
<!-- that we have not encountered before, -->
that vertex has just been discovered!

<p>
Any vertex that gets discovered is later explored.  The key to why
the algorithm works correctly is that
<ol>
  <li>Any vertex reachable from the source is eventually discovered.
  </li>
  <li>If vertices <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> are such that
      <em>d(u) < d(v)</em>, then <em>u</em> will be discovered before 
      <em>v</em>.  Consequently, <em>u</em> will be placed on the
      queue before <em>v</em> is, and hence <em>u</em>'s outgoing edges
      will be examined before <em>v</em>'s.
  </li>
  <li>If a vertex <em>x</em> has been discovered, then the value occupying
      <tt>dist[x]</tt> is equal to <em>d(x)</em> (<em>x</em>'s distance
      from the source vertex).
  </li>
  <li>Discovery of a vertex <em>y</em> via exploration from a vertex
      <em>x</em> guarantees that <em>d(y) = d(x) + 1</em>.  From the
      above two items, it follows that, upon discovering <em>y</em>, we are
      justified in storing <tt>dist[x] + 1</tt> into <tt>dist[y]</tt>).
      (In fact, we must do so in order to maintain the truth of the
      previous item!)
  </li>
</ol>

The key to achieving these properties is the use of the queue to
"schedule" the explorations of vertices.


<h3><b>Proof of queue-based algorithm for
uniform cost single source shortest path problem</b> (optional)</h3>

Throughout this section, we assume that <em>G</em> is a directed graph
whose set of edges is <em>E</em>.

<p>
<b>Lemma 1:</b> 
Let <em>(x,y)</em> be in <em>E</em>
and suppose that there is a path in <em>G</em> from <em>v</em> to <em>x</em>.
Then <em>d(y)</em> &lt;= <em>d(x)</em> + 1.
<p>
<b>Proof:</b> 
Take any shortest path from <em>v</em> to <em>x</em> 
(which, by definition of <em>d</em>, must
have length <em>d(x)</em>) and extend it by the edge <em>(x,y)</em>.
The resulting path from <em>v</em> to <em>y</em> has length
<em>d(x)</em> + 1; hence, the shortest path from <em>v</em> to <em>y</em>
is of that length or less, which is to say that 
<em>d(y)</em> &le; <em>d(x)</em> + 1.

<p>
<b>Lemma 2:</b> Let <em>d(y) = k</em>, where <em>k &gt; 0</em>.
<br>(a) Then there exists a vertex <em>x</em> for which 
<em>d(x) = k-1</em> and <em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>E</em>.
<br>(b) There is no vertex <em>x'</em> for which 
<em>d(x') &lt; k-1</em> and <em>(x',y)</em> is in <em>E</em>.

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>  Part (b) follows from Lemma 1.  As for Part (a), let
<em>P = w<sub>0</sub>, w<sub>1</sub>, ..., w<sub>k-1</sub>, w<sub>k</sub></em>
(with <em>w<sub>0</sub> = v</em> and 
<em>w<sub>k</sub> = y</em>) be a shortest path in <em>G</em> from
<em>v</em> to <em>y</em>.
Letting <em>x = w<sub>k-1</sub></em>, we have that 
<em>(x,y)</em> is in <em>E</em>.
<!--(or else the given path is not really a path). -->
It remains to show that <em>d(x) = k-1</em>.  
The prefix of <em>P</em> of length <em>k-1</em> is a path from 
<em>v</em> to <em>x</em>; hence <em>d(x) &le; k-1</em>. 
It remains only to show that <em>d(x)</em> &gt; k-2.
Suppose, to the contrary, that <em>d(x) = j</em>, where <em>j &le; k-2</em>.
But then, by Lemma 1, we would have <em>d(y) &le; j+1 &le; k-1</em>,
contradicting the assumption <em>d(y) = k</em>.

<p>
<b>Lemma 3:</b> Following initialization of every element of <tt>dist[]</tt>
to -1, every assignment to an element of that array changes its value from
-1 to some natural number.
<p>
<b>Proof:</b> The proof is by induction on the number of assignments made to
elements in <tt>dist[]</tt> following initialization.  The first one clearly
changes dist[v] from -1 to 0.  Every subsequent assignment to an element
of <tt>dist[]</tt> occurs inside the loop. 
By inspection of the code, it is clear that assignment to an element cannot
occur unless its value is -1.  Also, as the value it is given is one more
than that of another array element (whose value, the induction hypothesis
tells us, must be either -1 or a natural number, depending upon whether it
was ever changed), that value must be a natural number.

<p>
<b>Corollary 3.1:</b> 
Following initialization, no element of <tt>dist[]</tt> is the target
of more than one assignment.

<p>
<b>Corollary 3.2:</b> 
No vertex in G is discovered (i.e., placed on the queue) more than once.

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>
Inspection of the algorithm indicates that each discovery of a vertex
is immediately followed by an assignment to the corresponding element of
<tt>dist[]</tt>.
If a vertex were discovered more than once, the corresponding array
element would be the target of more than one assignment, contradicting
Corollary 3.1.

<p>
<b>Theorem:</b> 
Let <em>y</em> be a vertex reachable from <em>v</em>, and let 
<em>d(y) = k</em>.  Then
<ol>
  <li><em>y</em> will be discovered (i.e., placed on the queue) before
       any vertex at distance greater than <em>k</em> is discovered, and
  </li> 
  <li>Upon discovery of <em>y</em>, the value placed into <tt>dist[y]</tt>
       is <em>d(y)</em> (i.e., <em>k</em>),
       and, thereafter, <tt>dist[y]</tt> will never change.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Proof:</b>  The proof is by mathematical induction on <em>k</em>.

<p>
<b>Basis:</b> <em>k = 0</em>.
As the only vertex at distance zero from <em>v</em> is <em>v</em> itself, 
<em>y</em> must be <em>v</em>.  As <em>v</em> is the first vertex placed
on the queue, (1) clearly holds.  Also, zero is placed into <tt>dist[v]</tt>
prior to the loop, which, applying Corollary 3.1, gives us (2). 

<p>
<b>Induction Step:</b> Let <em>k > 0</em> and assume, as an 
induction hypothesis, that the theorem holds for all <em>k' < k</em>.
According to Lemma 2, among the vertices possessing an edge directed to 
<em>y</em>, none is at distance less than <em>k-1</em> from <em>v</em>,
but there is at least one at distance <em>k-1</em> from <em>v</em>.
Let <em>x</em> be the first such vertex to be discovered.  
By (2), <em>k-1</em> will be placed in <tt>dist[x]</tt> when <em>x</em> is
discovered and will remain there until termination of the program.
As vertices are explored in the same order as they are discovered (because the
algorithm employs a queue for "scheduling" these events), every vertex explored
before <em>x</em> (according to (1) of the induction hypothesis) is either 
at distance less than <em>k-1</em> from <em>v</em> or at distance 
<em>k-1</em> but having no edge to <em>y</em>.  By Lemma 2, none of the
vertices at distance less than <em>k-1</em> have edges to <em>y</em>.
Hence, <em>y</em> will be discovered during exploration of <em>x</em>.
Because (by (2) of the induction hypothesis) the value of <tt>dist[x]</tt>
is <em>k-1</em> at the time that <em>x</em> is explored, from
inspection of the program it follows that <em>k-1 + 1</em> 
(i.e., <em>k</em>) is placed into <tt>dist[y]</tt>, 
satisfying the first part of (2).  The second part of (2) follows
from Corollary 3.1.

<p>
As for (1), suppose, to the contrary, that some vertex <em>z</em> 
satisfying <em>d(z) &gt; k</em> were discovered before <em>y</em>.
By Lemma 2, such a discovery could only happen during exploration 
of a vertex <em>u</em> satisfying <em>d(u) &ge; k</em>.  
For <em>z</em> to be discovered before <em>y</em> would require that 
<em>u</em> be explored before <em>y</em>, which, by the use of the
queue for scheduling explorations, means that <em>z</em> would have been
discovered before <em>y</em>.
But this contradicts (1) of the induction hypothesis.

<H3>Implementation/Data Representation</H3>

<A Name="implementation_ary">
<H4>Array-based</H4>

<p>
<b>Naive Approach</b><br>
Following an approach similar to that used in developing an array-based
representation of a stack, let us propose the following array-based
representation scheme for queues: for a queue containing <tt>k</tt> items,
store (representations of) those items, in order from front to rear, 
in locations <tt>0, 1, ..., k-1</tt> of an array, which we will call
<tt>contents</tt>.  (The values of array elements at locations <tt>k</tt>
and beyond are irrelevant.)  Rather than referring to the number of items
as <tt>k</tt>, we shall use the variable <tt>numItems</tt> (just as in
the <tt>Stack</tt> class).

<p>
For example, a queue containing the characters '$', 'd', 'z', '#', 'A', 
and '9' (written from front to rear) would be represented as follows:
<pre>
           0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7               N-1
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+---+
contents |'$'|'d'|'z'|'#'|'A'|'9'|   |   |   ...      |   |
         +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+------------+---+
         +---+
numItems | 6 |
         +---+
</pre>
<p>
Having proposed a representation scheme, let's determine whether it admits
easy and efficient implementations of the standard queue operations.
To implement <tt>frontOf()</tt> is easy:  we simply return the value 
<tt>contents[0]</tt>.  As for <tt>enqueue()</tt>, it, too, is simple:
we simply store the value to be inserted into <tt>contents[numItems]</tt>
and then increment <tt>numItems</tt>.
(This assumes that <tt>numItems < N</tt>.  Otherwise, before inserting
the new value into the queue, we would have to create a new, longer array,
copy the contents of <tt>contents</tt> into it, and then, via assignment
statement, make <tt>contents</tt> refer to the new array.)

<p>
The <tt>dequeue()</tt> operation, however, does not work out so nicely.
In order to delete the item at the front of the queue, while at the same
time remaining faithful to our proposed representation scheme, we must
shift all the elements in <tt>contents[1..numItems-1]</tt> one location to
the "left" and then decrement <tt>numItems</tt>.  Shifting the elements
could be accomplished as follows:
<pre>
     for (int i = 0; i != numItems-1; i = i+1)
        { contents[i] = contents[i+1]; }  </pre>
Notice that execution of this requires time proportional to the number of
items on the queue.  In other words, it has <em>linear</em> running time.
Intuition tells us that we ought to be able to do better.

<p>
What would happen if we stored the queue items in the array in order from
rear to front, rather than front to rear?  That is, suppose that we kept
the rear item at location zero, the one preceding it (on the queue) at
location one, etc., etc., and the front item at location <tt>numItems-1</tt>.
Then to perform a <tt>dequeue()</tt> would be easy:  simply decrement
<tt>numItems</tt>.  But now <tt>enqueue()</tt> would require that we
shift <tt>contents[0..numItems-1]</tt> to the "right" one position so as to
make room (at location zero) for the value being inserted.  This requires
linear time, of course.  So this variation doesn't help.  For similar
reasons, storing the items at the "end" of the array, rather than at the
beginning, is no better.

<p>
<b>WrapAround Approach</b><BR>
It appears that the decision to keep all the items in the queue stored
in the "leftmost" (or "rightmost") segment of <tt>contents[]</tt> may
need to be relaxed in order to allow us to achieve a sub-linear
running time for both <tt>enqueue()</tt> <b>and</b> <tt>dequeue()</tt>.
So we propose the following:
Let the segment of <tt>contents[]</tt> holding the items on
the queue "float" through the array, and use <tt>int</tt> variables
<tt>frontLoc</tt> and <tt>rearLoc</tt> to indicate the boundaries of
that segment.  Suppose that <tt>frontLoc</tt> points directly to the
element holding the item at the front of the queue and that <tt>rearLoc</tt>
points to the element following the one holding the item at the rear.
Taking the example from above, one possible representation would be

<pre>
           0    ....  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51    ....  N-1
         +---+-------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+---+
contents |   |  .... |   |'$'|'d'|'z'|'#'|'A'|'9'|   |  .... |   |
         +---+-------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+-------+---+
         +---+
frontLoc | 45|
         +---+
         +---+
 rearLoc | 51|
         +---+
</pre>

<p>
With this representation, an <tt>enqueue()</tt> requires only that 
the new item be placed into <tt>contents[rearLoc]</tt> and that then
<tt>rearLoc</tt> be incremented.
To perform <tt>dequeue()</tt> requires
only that <tt>frontLoc</tt> be incremented.  Thus, we have achieved
simple and <b>constant-time</b> solutions for both of them.
How about the other operations?  Well, <tt>frontOf()</tt> is
implemented simply by returning the value in <tt>contents[frontLoc]</tt>.
As for <tt>isEmpty()</tt>, it should be clear that the condition of a queue
being empty corresponds, in our new representation scheme, to
<tt>frontLoc == rearLoc</tt>.

<p>
We are not quite finished, however, because an interesting question
arises:  what happens when <tt>rearLoc</tt> is <tt>N</tt> and an
<tt>enqueue()</tt> occurs?  (This will occur the <tt>(N+1)</tt>-st time
that <tt>enqueue()</tt> is invoked.)  One possible answer would be to
extend the length of <tt>contents[]</tt>.  But, except in the unlikely
event that <tt>frontLoc == 0</tt>, this is rather wasteful, because
the array segment <tt>contents[0..frontLoc-1]</tt> is, logically speaking,
empty.  In order to make use of it, we may imagine that location 0 comes
immediately <em>after</em> location <tt>N-1</tt>.  In other words,
we may view the array as being circular in layout, rather than linear.
Mathematically, it means that our index calculations should be carried
out "modulo N" &mdash;meaning that, when incrementing <tt>frontLoc</tt> or 
<tt>rearLoc</tt> (in performing a dequeue or enqueue, respectively),
we should increment and then take the remainder of division by N.
In other words, if incrementing <tt>frontLoc</tt> (or <tt>rearLoc</tt>)
results in its having value <tt>N</tt>, its value should be set to zero!

<p>
To illustrate this "wrap-around" scheme, the following is another
possible representation of the queue from above, under the assumption
that <tt>N = 75</tt>.
<pre>
           0   1   2      ....    70  71  72  73  74
         +---+---+---+-----------+---+---+---+---+---+
contents |'A'|'9'|   |    ....   |   |'$'|'d'|'z'|'#'|
         +---+---+---+-----------+---+---+---+---+---+
         +---+
frontLoc | 71|

<p>
Under this scheme, what do we do upon an attempt to insert (i.e., enqueue)
if the array <tt>contents</tt> is "full"?
For that matter, how do we determine whether or not it is full?
It would seem that the condition <tt>frontLoc == rearLoc</tt> corresponds
to the array being full, because that would indicate that the array segment
<tt>contents[frontLoc..N-1]</tt> contains the items on the initial part of
the queue and that <tt>contents[0..frontLoc-1]</tt> contains the remaining
items.  But earlier ---when we considered how to tell whether or not the
queue was empty--- we claimed that the same condition indicated an empty
queue!  So, which is it?!  Well, it could be either one!
That is, the condition <tt>frontLoc == rearLoc</tt> indicates that either
the queue is empty <b>or</b> that the array holding its items is full.
In order to determine which it is, more information is needed! 

<P>
A good way to provide the extra information is to introduce another
instance variable, say <tt>numItems</tt>, whose value indicates the
number of items currently occupying the queue.  To maintain its value,
we simply increment it each time an item is enqueued and decrement it
each time an item is dequeued.  In order to determine whether the queue
is empty, it suffices to compare <tt>numItems</tt> against zero.
Similarly, to determine whether <tt>contents[]</tt> is full, it suffices
to compare <tt>numItems</tt> against <tt>contents.length</tt>.
Employing this approach, one never need test for the condition
<tt>frontLoc == rearLoc</tt>, as it will hold if and only if either
<tt>numItems = 0</tt> or <tt>numItems = contents.length</tt>.

<P>
<em>Note:</em>
An alternative approach for storing the extra information is to have an
instance variable whose purpose is "to remember" which of the two
mutation operations was applied most recently.
If <tt>frontLoc == rearLoc</tt> and <tt>enqueue</tt> (respectively,
<tt>dequeue</tt>) was most recently applied, the array is full
(respectively, the queue is empty).
<em>End of note.</em>

<p>
Having introduced <tt>numItems</tt>, we consider the relationship
that exists between it, <tt>frontLoc</tt>, and <tt>rearLoc</tt>.
Clearly, the value of <tt>rearLoc</tt> should always
be precisely <tt>numItems</tt> positions "to the right" (using
wraparound when necessary) of <tt>frontLoc</tt>.  That is, an
invariant of our representation scheme is
<p>
<center><tt>rearLoc = (frontLoc + numItems) % contents.length</tt></center>

<p>
In other words, the value of <tt>rearLoc</tt> is calculable from the
values of the other two.
It follows that we don't need the variable <tt>rearLoc</tt>!
In its place, we may use the right-hand side of the above equation.

<p>
Here is the complete implementation:

<H3>Reference-Based Implementation/Data Representation</H3>

One of the less attractive features of using an array as the basis
upon which to represent a queue is that, when the queue's size becomes
"incompatible" with the size of the array (i.e., when either the
queue has become too large to fit into the array or it has become
so small that a significant portion of the array is unused), 
it becomes necessary/wise to create a new, differently-sized array
and to copy all the relevant data into it from the old array.
In order to ensure that this "size-change" operation does not
dominate the time required to process queue operations,
the new array's size should be significantly different from the old one.
(In our implementation, the new array is made to be either double
or half the size of the old one.)
<p>
Hence, although the abstract queue structure is growing and shrinking
in small increments, the underlying structure used to represent it is
growing and shrinking (occasionally) in large increments.

<p>
A concrete representation that makes use of references, rather than an
array, can conveniently grow and shrink incrementally, just like the
abstract structure that it represents.

<p>
The idea is to make use of a (generic) class that provides one-directional
linking capabilities.  We shall call this class <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em>.
An object of this class can be depicted as

<pre>
                           +---+---+
                           | x | x-+----> points to a Link1&lt;T&gt; object
                           +-+-+---+
                             |
                             |
                             v
                         points to an object of type T</pre>

That is, a <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em> object contains a reference to an
object (of type <tt>T</tt>) and a reference to
another object of type <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em>.  An implementation of
this class is as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>public class Link1&lt;T&gt; {

   protected T item;
   protected Link1&lt;T&gt; next;

   public Link1(T item, Link1&lt;T&gt; next)
      { this.item = item;  this.next = next; }

   public Link1(T item) { this(item, null); }

   public Link1() { this(null, null); }

   public T getItem() { return this.item; }
   public Link1&lt;T&gt; getNext() { return this.next; }

   public void setItem(T newItem) { this.item = newItem; }
   public void setNext(T newNext) { this.next = newNext; }
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Using <tt>Link1</tt> as a basis, we can represent the queue containing
COW, CAT, DOG, BUG, and ANT objects as follows:
<pre>
+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+
| COW | x-+---->| CAT | x-+---->| DOG | x-+---->| BUG | x-+---->| ANT | x-+--!
+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+
     ^                                                              ^
     |                                                              |
     |                                                              |
   +-+-+                                                          +-+-+
   | x |                                                          | x |
   +---+                                                          +---+
   front                                                          rear</pre>

<p>
For simplicity, we have simply written each <em>Link1</em> object's animal
name inside (the box representing) its first field.
In reality, each such field is a reference (i.e., pointer) to the
corresponding animal object.

<p>
Following this approach, here is the queue class that we derive:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>
<pre>/*
** Java class for queues; data representation is based upon use of the
** Link1 class.  A queue is represented by references front and rear,

*/

import Link1;

class QueueViaLink1&lt;T&gt; implements Queue&lt;T&gt; {
 
   Link1&lt;T&gt; front;  // points to front of queue
   Link1&lt;T&gt; rear;   // points to rear of queue


   /*  c o n s t r u c t o r  */

   /* pre:  none
   ** post: isEmpty()
   */
   public QueueViaLink1() { 
      front = null;
      rear = null;
   }


   /*   o b s e r v e r s  */

   /* pre: none
   ** post: returns true iff the queue is empty
   */
   public boolean isEmpty() { return front == null; }


   /* pre:  !isEmpty()
   ** post: object returned is that at front of the queue
   */
   public T frontOf() { return front.getItem(); }


   /*   m u t a t o r s  */


   /* pre: !isEmpty()
   ** post: queue has been modified so that item at front has been removed
   */
   public void dequeue()  { front = front.getNext(); }


   /* pre:  none
   ** post: item will have been placed at the rear of 'this'
   */
   public void enqueue(T item) { 

      Link1&lt;T&gt; newRear = new Link1&lt;T&gt;(item, null);
      if (isEmpty())
         { front = newRear; }
      else
         { rear.setNext(newRear); }
      rear = newRear;
   }
}</pre>
</td></tr>

</center>

<p>
A slightly different approach, which is more clever but not really any
better, is to use a <em>circular</em> chain of <em>Link1</em> objects.
Here, the class implementing queues needs only a single variable,
which is a reference to the <em>Link1</em> object corresponding to 
the rear of the queue.  As the chain is circular, this object includes
a reference to the front of the queue, so there is no need for the
queue class to include an instance variable pointing to the front of the
queue.  Here is a picture depicting the situation:
<pre>
     +---------<--------------------------<---------------------<-------+
     |                                                                  |
     v                                                                  |
+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+-+-+

+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+
                                                                    ^
                                                                    |
                                                                    |
                                                                  +-+-+
                                                                  | x |
                                                                  +---+
