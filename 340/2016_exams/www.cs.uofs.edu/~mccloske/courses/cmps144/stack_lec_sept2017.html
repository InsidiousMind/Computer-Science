<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p>
You're waiting in line to eat at the cafeteria.  As you draw nearer to the
service counter, you pass by a stack of trays.  Following the lead of those
ahead of you in line, you grab the tray on top.

</p><p>
After obtaining your meal, you happen to sit at a table not far from the
waiting line.  You notice that a cafeteria employee
&mdash;who has emerged from the kitchen walking alongside a
battery-powered cart of freshly-washed trays&mdash;
is about to replenish the stack of trays, which by now has become
quite low.  The employee, who is old and frail, can lift only one tray at
a time.  She places the freshly-washed trays onto the top of the stack,
one by one.

</p><p>
From these experiences, you make the following observations:
When a tray is removed from a stack, it is the one that was on top.  
When a tray is placed onto a stack, it is placed on top.  
After considering the implications of this, you arrive at the following
conclusion:  Among all the trays on a stack at a given moment, the one 
among them that will be <em>removed first</em> is the one that was 
<em>placed onto the stack last</em>.
(This is not quite as trivial as it may sound, because any number of
insertions/removals may occur in the meantime.) 
That is, a stack of trays obeys a <b>LIFO</b> ("last in, first out") 
insertion/deletion pattern.

</p><p>
The concept of a stack in computer science is analogous to a stack of trays
in a cafeteria.  A stack is simply a collection of items such that arrivals
and departures conform to a LIFO pattern.  Another way to look at it is this:
A stack is a sequence of items such that all insertions and deletions occur
at the same end.  Keeping the cafeteria trays in mind, we call this end the
"top" of the stack.

</p><p>
Commonly, it is also taken as part of the definition that, among the items
currently on a stack, the only one that can be observed is the one at the
top.  (Imagine that each cafeteria tray has a serial number etched into it,
such that it is visible only if no other tray is sitting on top of it.)
We shall not follow this approach, however.  Rather, we will assume that
any item on the stack can be observed, and that each of them is referred
to by its position on the stack (with the item at the top having position
zero, the one below that having position one, etc.).

</p><p>
For historical reasons, the add/insert operation on stacks is usually called
<b>push</b> and the remove/delete operation is usually called <b>pop</b>.
Modeling this stack concept as a generic Java interface (where the generic
type parameter indicates the data type of the items to be inserted into 
the stack), we get the following:

<h3>Applications of Stacks:</h3>
<p>
You may find it surprising to learn that, despite the simplicity of the
concept, stacks are quite useful in practice.

<H4>Managing Program Execution</H4>
<p>
A stack is used for managing the flow of execution every time
you run a program.  You are aware of the fact that, when a method is
called, the caller's execution is suspended while the method executes.
When the called method terminates, execution resumes within the caller at
the command immediately following the one making the call.
(The address of this command is called the <em>return address</em>.)
This sounds fairly simple, but what happens when a method, having been called,
calls another one (or even itself), which calls another one, which calls
yet another, etc., etc.?  Some systematic method for keeping track of
return addresses is needed in order to ensure that, as each method terminates,
execution resumes at the appropriate place.
It turns out that the information necessary for keeping track of all this
can be stored (and accessed) in a quite orderly manner:  by using a stack that
holds the return addresses.

<p>
As an example, suppose that we have a program
<pre>
Method A:         Method B:           Method C:          Method D:
--------          --------            --------           --------
    ...               Call C;            ...                ...
    ...            B1:...                ...                ...
    Call B;           ...                 Call D;           End;
 A1:...               Call C;          C1:...
    ...            B2:End;                End;
    Call C;
 A2:...
    End;
</pre>

The labels <tt>A1</tt>, <tt>A2</tt>, <tt>B1</tt>, and <tt>C1</tt>
indicate the addresses of the commands at which execution should resume
after the method called on the preceding line finishes.  Each time a
call occurs, the corresponding return address is pushed onto the run-time
stack.  Each time a method terminates execution, the return address at the
top of the run-time stack is popped and execution resumes at the location
that it indicates.  During execution of the example program above, the
run-time stack will take on the following configurations (with elements
written from bottom to top):

<pre>
   contents        last change
-------------------------------------------------
 1. A1              A calls B; return address is pushed
 2. A1 B1           B calls C; return address is pushed
 3. A1 B1 C1        C calls D; return address is pushed
 4. A1 B1           D terminates; C1 is popped; execution resumes there
 5. A1              C terminates; B1 is popped; execution resumes there
 6. A1 B2           B calls C (again); return address is pushed
 7. A1 B2 C1        C calls D; return address is pushed
 8. A1 B2           D terminates; C1 is popped; execution resumes there
 9. A1              C terminates; B2 is popped; execution resumes there
10. [empty]         B terminates; A1 is popped; execution resumes there
11. A2              A calls C; return address is pushed
12. A2 C1           C calls D; return address is pushed
13. A2              D terminates; C1 is popped; execution resumes there
14. [empty]         C terminates; A2 is popped; execution resumes there
</pre>



<H4>Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions</H4>
<p>
Another application of stacks is in the evaluation of arithmetic expressions.
In order to keep things simple, here we will focus upon so-called 
<em>fully-parenthesized infix arithmetic expressions</em>, 
abbreviated "FPAIE".
In such an expression, only infix operators that apply to numbers
can appear (which excludes unary <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt>).
By "fully-parenthesized", we mean that the expression contains a mated pair
of parentheses for every occurrence of an operator symbol.  That is, the
left operand of each operator is immediately preceded by
&nbsp;<tt>(</tt>&nbsp; and the right operand is immediately followed by 
&nbsp;<tt>)</tt>&nbsp;. 
An example of such an expression, annotated to show the connections 
between parentheses and operators, is

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>
<pre>
             (((15 - 1) + 2) + (3 * ((6 + 0) / (1 + 2))))
             |||___|__| |  | | |  | ||__|__| | |__|__||||
             ||_________|__| | |  | |________|________|||
             |               | |__|____________________||
             |_______________|__________________________|</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
We can define FPAIE's (recursively) as follows: 

<p>
An FPAIE is either
<ol>
   <li>a numeric literal, or </li>
   <li>an expression of the form &nbsp;<tt>( F op G )</tt>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
where <tt>F</tt> and <tt>G</tt> are themselves FPAIE's and <tt>op</tt> is 
an infix arithmetic operator (e.g., <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, etc.).
We refer to FPAIE's of the first form as <em>atomic</em> and
those of the second form as <em>compound</em>.

<p>
Using a context-free grammar, we can state the definition like this:
<pre>
   &lt;FPAIE&gt;     --->  &lt;numeric literal&gt;
   &lt;FPAIE&gt;     --->  ( &lt;FPAIE&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;FPAIE&gt; )
   &lt;operator&gt; ---> +  <b>|</b>  -  <b>|</b>  *  <b>|</b>  /
</pre>

<p>
<!-- <b>Notes:</b> -->
<b>Note:</b>
<!--(1)-->The boldfaced vertical bars are used for separating
alternatives.  Hence, the third line of the grammar says that an
operator is either a plus sign, or a minus sign, or etc., etc.
<!--
<br />
(2) This definition allows only binary operators, and thus
excludes unary <tt>+</tt> and <tt>-</tt> (as in <tt>-4</tt>).  
We could repair this, but, to keep matters as simple as possible, we won't.
-->
</b>End of note.</b>

</p><p>
How does one evaluate such an expression?  Most likely, you would find an
<em>immediately evaluable</em> compound subexpression (i.e., one of the
form <tt>(A op B)</tt>, where <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> are numeric literals),
you would evaluate it, and then you would replace it by the corresponding
numeric literal.  You would repeat this until the original expression
had been reduced to a single numeric literal constituting the final result.

</p><p>
For the sake of making this precise, observe that, in an FPAIE, the
leftmost immediately evaluable subexpression is always the one ending with
the leftmost right parenthesis.  Suppose that we always choose that
subexpression as the one to evaluate next.  Applying this strategy to the
FPAIE given above, we get, on successive iterations:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="0">
<tr><td>
<pre>   ((<u>(15 - 1)</u> + 2) + (3 * ((6 + 0) / (1 + 2))))

=  (<u>(   14    + 2)</u> + (3 * ((6 + 0) / (1 + 2))))

=  (         16    + (3 * (<u>(6 + 0)</u> / (1 + 2))))

=  (         16    + (3 * (   6    / <u>(1 + 2)</u>)))

=  (         16    + (3 * <u>(   6    /    3   )</u>))

=  (         16    + <u>(3 *          2         )</u>)

=  <u>(         16    +    6                     )</u>

=                 22</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
In each expression, the leftmost immediately evaluable subexpression is
underlined.

</p><p>
Using our human common sense, this was easy.  But how can we give precise
instructions to a computer &mdash;which has absolutely no sense&mdash;
that would make it correctly evaluate such an expression?
Letting E denote the FPAIE to be evaluated, our approach may be expressed
in pseudocode as follows:
</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>set a pointer to the beginning of E;
while (E is not a numeric literal) {
   advance the pointer until encountering a right parenthesis;
   evaluate the subexpression ending at that right parenthesis 
   replace that subexpression with the corresponding numeric literal;
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

<p>
Although this is still somewhat vague, it provides a basis for a more
precise algorithm.   Among the details to be worked out is how the program
determines, upon encountering a right parenthesis, which subexpression is
to be evaluated.  One way would be to scan to the left (i.e., backwards)
until encountering the matching left parenthesis.
Necessarily, between the two parentheses there would be a numeric literal,
an operator, and another numeric literal.  (Either or both of those numeric
literals could be the result of having evaluated a complicated subexpression
earlier.)  How does the program scan to the left?  In what kind of storage
structure do the values of already-evaluated subexpressions reside?

</p><p>
One way to store them is by using two stacks, which we refer to as the
<em>operand stack</em> and <em>operator stack</em>, respectively.
As we scan the expression from left to right, on the latter we store the
operator symbols and on the former we store the values of the operands.
Upon encountering a right parenthesis (which, as noted before, indicates
that we have reached the end of the leftmost immediately evaluable
compound subexpression), we pop an operator symbol off one stack and
two values from the other stack, we apply that operator to those two values,
and then we push the result back onto the operand stack.
After the last token of the FPAIE has been processed, its value 
will be the lone value remaining on the operand stack.

</p><p>
In order to prove that this works, we can show that each time a right
parenthesis is encountered, the operator to which it corresponds is at
the top of the operator stack and the (values of the) two operands to which
it corresponds are the top two numbers on the operand stack. 
Such a proof is omitted, but the reader is encouraged to do several
examples, after which he should be convinced of the claim's plausibility.
<!-- (The exceptionally ambitious reader is encouraged to supply a proof!) -->

</p><p>
We formalize the above with the following Java-like method.
It assumes the existence of classes <tt>Expr</tt>, <tt>Token</tt>,
and <tt>Operator</tt> having the instance methods that are invoked
and a class <tt>StackX</tt> that implements the interface <tt>Stack</tt>
shown above.  For simplicity, it also assumes that all numeric literals 
describe integers.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>/* pre:  e is a syntactically correct FPAIE
   post: value returned is that obtained by evaluating e
*/
public Integer evaluate( Expr e ) {

   Stack&lt;Integer&gt; operandStk = new StackX&lt;Integer&gt;();
   Stack&lt;Operator&gt; operatorStk = new StackX&lt;Operator&gt;();
   Token t = e.firstToken();

   while (e.hasMoreTokens()) {
      t = e.nextToken();
      if (t is a left parenthesis)       { }
      else if (t is an integer literal)  { operandStk.push(t); }
      else if (t is an operator)         { operatorStk.push(t); }
      else if (t is a right parenthesis) {
         Integer y = operandStk.topOf();
         operandStk.pop();
         Integer x = operandStk.topOf();
         operandStk.pop();
         Operator op = operatorStk.topOf();
         operatorStk.pop();
         operandStk.push( op.apply(x,y) ); // apply op to x and y; push result
      }
   }
   return operandStk.topOf();
}</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
As indicated by its precondition, the method above assumes that its
parameter is a syntactically correct FPAIE.
Interestingly, it will work "correctly" even if there are certain
syntactic "irregularities".
For example, left parentheses are optional!
(Which tells us that left parentheses are not really needed and
serve only as visual cues to the reader.)
As another example, in a subexpression whose left (respectively, right)
operand is a numeric literal, no harm will result from the operator 
appearing before (resp., after) that literal.
Examples: <tt>5 + 3) - 2)</tt>;&nbsp; 
<tt>( + 5 (3 - 2))</tt>; &nbsp; <tt>((5 + 3) 2 -))</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>Note:</b>
If we wanted the method to detect syntax errors in the given expression,
an appropriate approach would be to use only one stack rather than two.
In scanning the expression from left-to-right, all tokens would be
pushed onto the stack, except for <b>)</b>'s.  Upon encountering
one of these, we would pop the stack four times, the expectation
being that the four items popped would be, in order,
<ol>
  <li>the right operand of the subexpression ended by that <b>)</b></li>
  <li>the operator of that subexpression</li>
  <li>the left operand of that subexpression</li>
  <li>the right parenthesis's mate</li>
</ol>
If any of the popped items were not of the right type (e.g., a <b>(</b>
rather than a number), or if the stack became empty before the fourth pop,
that would signal a syntax error in the original FPAIE.
</p><p>
Conceptually, this is simple, but, depending upon the programming language,
it may not be trivial to implement because it requires that the stacks be 
heterogeneous (i.e., have the ability to hold items of different data types).
In Java, we could do this by instantiating the Stack class with the type
Object and, each time a pop occurs, using a cast to convert the popped
item into a value of the expected type.  If such a cast could not be
carried out due to a type mismatch, an exception would be thrown,
allowing us to detect a syntax error. 
<b>End of note.</b>

<!--
It is not hard to augment the method in order to give it the ability 
to detect when its parameter is not syntactically correct.
To accomplish this, use the two stacks to hold not only operand and 
operator values, respectively, but also left parentheses.  
(<b>Note:</b> Conceptually, this is simple, but, depending upon the
programming language, it may not be trivial to implement because it requires
that the stacks be heterogeneous (i.e., have the ability to hold items of
different data types).
(In Java, we could do this by instantiating the Stack class with the type
Object.)
When a left parenthesis is encountered, push it onto both stacks.
When a right parenthesis is encountered, do as specified above, but also
do an extra pop on both stacks.  If the extra tokens popped are not both
left parentheses, the original FPAIE was syntactically invalid.

<a name="implementation_ary">
<h3>An Array-based Implementation/Data Representation</h3>

<p>
The most obvious way to represent a stack using an array turns out to be
a good way of doing it.  We simply store
&mdash;in elements 0, 1, etc., of the array (call it <tt>contents</tt>)&mdash;
the items that are currently on the stack, from bottom to top.
In order to perform a <tt>pop</tt> or <tt>push</tt>, there must be some
way to tell which location of the array corresponds to the top 
of the stack.  To fulfill this purpose, we use an instance variable of type
<tt>int</tt>, <tt>numItems</tt>, whose value indicates the number of items
currently occupying the stack.  That is, the values occupying 
<tt>contents[0..numItems-1]</tt> should correspond to the items on the stack. 
In particular, the item stored in <tt>contents[numItems-1]</tt> (assuming
that <tt>numItems > 0</tt>) is the item at the top of the stack.

<p>
Under this representation scheme, each method in the class can be written
using code that is very simple (for a reader to follow) and very
efficient (for a computer to execute).

<p>
As an example, suppose that we have a stack of creatures from the class
<tt>Animal</tt>.  For simplicity, each animal will be denoted by its name
(e.g., COW).  The picture below corresponds to the representation of a
stack with five animals on it.  The values in array elements
<tt>5, 6, ..., N-1</tt> (where <tt>N == contents.length</tt>) are shown
as "---", which is intended to indicate that they are irrelevant.

<pre>
        +-----+
     N-1| --- |
      . |  .  |
      . |  .  |
      . |  .  |
      6 | --- |
      5 | --- |
      4 | DOG |
      3 | CAT |
      2 | BUG |       
      1 | EEL |     +-----+
      0 | COW |     |  5  |
        +-----+     +-----+
        contents    numItems </pre>

<p>
The only serious question that arises in implementing this approach is 
what to do in response to a <tt>push</tt> when the array 
<tt>contents</tt> is "full" (i.e., the number of items on the stack 
is equal to <tt>contents.length</tt>).
One reasonable answer is to create a larger array, copy the elements
of <tt>contents[]</tt> into that array, and then make <tt>contents[]</tt>
refer to the new array.  In effect, this lengthens <tt>contents[]</tt>
at a cost (in running time) that is proportional to its current
length (i.e., its length before lengthening it!).
<p>
But by how much should we lengthen the array?  By one element?  By 10?
Actually, it turns out that, in order to ensure that the total cost of
all lengthenings is (at worst) proportional to the total number
of <tt>push</tt> operations performed upon the stack during its lifetime,
we should lengthen the array each time by some fraction of its current
length.
<!-- (The reasoning behind this claim is beyond the scope of the course.) -->
A good fraction to use is 1, which would mean that the array is
doubled in length each time.
<!-- It turns out that one good strategy is to double the size of the array.
This ensures that, in the long run, the time used for lengthening the
array (possibly many times) cannot exceed that used in placing new elements
into it. -->

</p><p>
In order to avoid wasting space, the <tt>pop</tt> method should
detect when the number of items on the stack has become so few, relative
to <tt>contents.length</tt>, that <tt>contents[]</tt> should be
contracted (i.e., made shorter in length).
It turns out that one good strategy is to cut the array in half whenever
a pop reduces the number of items on the stack to less than a fourth of
the array's length.

</p><p>
The resulting class would look much like the following.

<h3>A Reference-Based Implementation/Data Representation</h3>

One of the less attractive features of using an array as the basis
upon which to represent a stack is that, when the stack's size becomes
"incompatible" with the size of the array (i.e., when either the
stack has become too large to fit into the array or it has become
so small that a significant portion of the array is unused),
it becomes necessary/wise to create a new, differently-sized array
and to copy all the relevant data into it from the old array.
In order to ensure that this "size-change" operation does not
dominate the time required to process stack operations,
the new array's size should be significantly different from the old one.
(In our implementation, the new array is made to be either double
or half the size of the old one.)
</p><p>
Hence, although the abstract stack structure is growing and shrinking
in small increments, the underlying structure used to represent it is
growing and shrinking in large increments.

</p><p>
A concrete representation that makes use of references, rather than an
array, can conveniently grow and shrink incrementally, just like the
abstract structure that it represents.

The idea is to make use of a (generic) class that provides one-directional
linking capabilities.  We shall call this class <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em>.
An object of this class can be depicted as

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
<tr><td>
<pre>
  item   next
+------+------+
|   x  |   x--+----> another Link1&lt;T&gt; object
+---+--+------+
    |
    |
    v
  +----+
  |    | (object of type T)
  +----+
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
That is, a <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em> object contains a reference to an
object (of type <tt>T</tt>) and a reference to
another object of type <em>Link1&lt;T&gt;</em>.  An implementation of
this class is as follows:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="12">
<tr><td>
<pre><code>/** An instance of this class contains a reference to an object of the
**  specified type T (the generic type parameter) and a reference to
**  an object of the same kind (i.e., Link1<T>).  The idea is that objects
**  of this class can be used as building blocks of one-directional linked
**  structures (i.e., one-way lists).
*/
public class Link1&lt;T&gt; { 

   /*  instance variables  */

   private T item;
   private Link1&lt;T&gt; next;

   /*  constructors  */

   public Link1(T item, Link1&lt;T&gt; next)
   { 
      this.item = item; this.next = next;
   }

   public Link1(T item) { this(item, null); }

   public Link1() { this(null, null); }


   /*  observers  */

   public T getItem() { return item; }
   public Link1&lt;T&gt; getNext() { return next; }


   /*  mutators  */

   public void setItem(T newItem) { item = newItem; }
   public void setNext(Link1&lt;T&gt; newNext) { next = newNext; }

}
</code></pre>
</tr></td>
</table>
</center>


</p><p>
Using <tt>Link1</tt> as a basis, we can represent the stack containing
COW, CAT, DOG, BUG, and ANT objects (going from top to bottom) as follows,
where <tt>top</tt> is the lone instance variable comprising the state
of the stack and it points to the Link1&lt;T&gt; object corresponding
to the top item on the stack:
<pre>
+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+
| COW | x-+---->| CAT | x-+---->| DOG | x-+---->| BUG | x-+---->| ANT | x-+--!
+-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+     +-----+---+
     ^
     |
     |
   +-+-+
   | x |
   +---+
    top </pre>
    
</p><p>
For simplicity, we have simply written each <em>Link1</em> object's
animal name inside (the box representing) its first field.
In reality, each such field is a reference (i.e., pointer) to the
corresponding animal object.

<p>
Following this approach, here is the stack class that we derive:
