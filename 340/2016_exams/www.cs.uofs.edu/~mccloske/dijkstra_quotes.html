<h3>Memorable Quotes from Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002)</h3>

"It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that
have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are
mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration."

<p>
"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be
regarded as a criminal offense."

<p>
"APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection. It is the language of
the future for the programming techniques of the past: it creates a new
generation of coding bums."

<p>
"Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to
show their absence!"

<p>
"The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting
than the question of whether a submarine can swim."

<p>
"Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
telescopes."

<p>
"Progress is possible only if we train ourselves to think about
programs without thinking of them as pieces of executable code."

<p>
"If in physics there's something you don't understand, you can always hide
behind the uncharted depths of nature. You can always blame God. You didn't
make it so complex yourself. But if your program doesn't work, there is no
one to hide behind. You cannot hide behind an obstinate nature. If it
doesn't work, you've messed up."

<p>
"Don't blame me for the fact that competent programming, as I view it as
an intellectual possibility, will be too difficult for 'the average
programmer'.  You must not fall into the trap of rejecting a surgical
technique because it is beyond the capabilities of the barber in his
shop around the corner."

<p>
"Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could
only have originated in California."

<p>
"The effort of using machines to mimic the human mind has always struck
me as rather silly. I would rather use them to mimic something better."

<p>
My only personal encounter with Dijkstra occurred at SIGCSE 2000 in
Austin, Texas.  After the luncheon presentation, during which the speaker
discussed his use of Visual Basic in teaching a computer literacy-type 
course, a number of the conference attendees lined up to meet Dijkstra.
When it became my turn to approach the great man, Dijkstra asked me,
"What is Visual Basic?"  I replied that it was a programming language
particularly well-suited for generating graphical user interfaces.
To that, he sighed and said, "Ah, bells and whistles."
