<H2>Binary Tree Traversals</H2>

<p>
Suppose that each node of a binary tree T has a label (i.e., name).
We define the <b>In-Order</b> listing of T to be that produced by
the following recursive procedure:
<pre>procedure In-Order( T : Binary_Tree ) is
begin
   if T is empty then
      do nothing;
   else
      In-Order( left subtree of T );
      print the label of the root of T;
      In-Order( right subtree of T );
   end if;
end In-Order;</pre>

<p>
By "left subtree of T" we mean the subtree of T rooted at the left
child of the root of T.  (If the root of T has no left child, then
this subtree is empty.)  Of course, "right subtree of T" is similar.

We define the <b>Post-Order</b> listing of T to be that produced by
the following recursive procedure:
<pre>procedure Post-Order( T : Binary_Tree ) is
begin
   if T is empty then
      do nothing;
   else
      Post-Order( left subtree of T );
      Post-Order( right subtree of T );
      print the label of the root of T;
   end if;
end Post-Order;</pre>

<p>
Finally, we define the <b>Pre-Order</b> listing of T to be that produced
by the following recursive procedure:
<pre>procedure Pre-Order( T : Binary_Tree ) is
begin
   if T is empty then
      do nothing;
   else
      print the label of the root of T;
      Pre-Order( left subtree of T );
      Pre-Order( right subtree of T );
   end if;
end Pre-Order;</pre>

<p>
The three kinds of listings are produced by nearly identical algorithms.
The only difference among them is the choice of when to print the label
of the root relative to when the labels in the left and right subtrees
are printed.

<p>
Interestingly, if you know two of the three listings of some binary tree,
then you can determine the third one.  You are to develop a program that,
given the In-Order and Post-Order listings of a binary tree, is able
to determine its Pre-Order listing.  

<p>
The input will be a sequence of binary trees each of whose nodes is
labeled by an upper case letter.
Each tree will be described on three lines.
The first line will be a positive integer indicating the number of nodes
in the tree.  This number will be no more than 26.
The second line will contain the tree's In-Order listing.
The third will contain its Post-Order listing.

<p>
For each binary tree given as input, the program should produce a single
line of output containing that tree's Pre-Order listing.
