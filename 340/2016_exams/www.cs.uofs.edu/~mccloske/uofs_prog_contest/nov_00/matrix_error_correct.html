<H2>Boolean Matrix Error Correction</H2>

A boolean matrix is one in which each element is either 0 or 1.
Such a matrix is said to possess the <b>even parity property</b> if
each row and each column has an even sum,
i.e., contains an even number of 1's.
Here's a 4 x 4 matrix which has the even parity property:

<p>
<pre>1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1
</pre>

<p>
The sums of the rows are 2, 0, 4, and 2, respectively, and the sum of 
each and every column is 2.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input a series of boolean matrices,
and, for each one, determines whether it possesses the even parity property.
If a matrix does possess this property, your program should report that
fact (by printing the message "OK").  
If not, your program should determine whether the even parity property can 
be established by flipping only one bit in the matrix.  If so, the program
should report the location of such a bit.  (The location of the bit in the
i-th row and j-th column is denoted by the ordered pair <b>(i,j)</b>.
We count rows from top to bottom and columns from left to right
starting at zero.)
If it is not possible to establish the even parity property by flipping
only a single bit, your program is to report that the matrix is
"corrupt".

<p>
Each matrix given as input will be a square matrix (meaning that it has
an equal number of rows and columns) having at most 20 rows.
Each matrix will be represented using <em>n</em>+1 lines, where <em>n</em>
is the number of rows (and columns).  The first line shall contain the
number <em>n</em> and each of the following <em>n</em> lines will contain
one row from the matrix (a sequence of <em>n</em> 0's and 1's, separated
from each other by spaces).

<p>
<b>Sample Input</b>
<pre>4
1 0 1 0
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 0 1 0
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1
4
1 0 1 0
0 1 1 0
1 1 1 1
0 1 0 1</pre>

<p>
<b>Sample Output</b>
<pre>OK
Change bit at location (1,2)
Corrupt</pre>
