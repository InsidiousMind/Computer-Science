    Problem 1: Shortest Substring Containing a Subsequence
</H2>
-->
<H2>Shortest Substring Containing a Subsequence</H2>


<p>
Let S and T be character strings.
We say that S is a <b>subsequence</b> of T if the characters that
comprise S appear in the same order within T, but not necessarily
adjacent to one another. &nbsp;For example, <b>MOO</b> is a subsequence
of <b>NONMONOTONIC</b>, because the letters <b>M</b>, 
<b>O</b>, and <b>O</b> appear within <b>NONMONOTONIC</b>
as the fourth, fifth, and seventh letters, respectively.
&nbsp;However, <b>POT</b> is neither a subsequence of <b>LIFTS</b>
nor of <b>ATROPHY</b>.  In the first case, not all of the letters in
<b>POT</b> appear in <b>LIFTS</b>; in the second case,
although all the letters of <b>POT</b> are present in
<b>ATROPHY</b>, they are not in the proper order.

<p>
You are to develop a program that takes as input a sequence of
pairs of character strings.  Each line will contain a single string
of length no more than 40.  (Thus, the first pair of strings appears
on lines 1 and 2, the second pair on lines 3 and 4, etc., etc.)
For each pair of strings S and T, your program is to report whether 
or not S is a subsequence of T.
If it is not, your program should simply print "NO"; 
if it is, your program should print the starting and ending 
positions of the <b>shortest</b> substring of T containing S 
as a subsequence.
(Positions are numbered from left to right starting at 0.)
If there are two or more shortest substrings of T containing S as a
subsequence, identify the leftmost such substring.
