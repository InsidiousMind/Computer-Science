<H2>Decimal Representation of Rational Numbers</H2>

<p>
A rational number is one that can be expressed as a fraction 
<b>k/m</b>, where k and m are integers and m is nonzero.
It turns out that these are also the numbers than can be 
expressed in <em>repeating decimal</em> form.
That is, every rational number can also be written in the form
<p>
<center>p.d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> d<sub>3</sub> 
... d<sub>n-r</sub> <b>(</b>
d<sub>n-r+1</sub> d<sub>n-r+2</sub> ...  d<sub>n</sub> <b>)</b>
</center>
<br>
where p is an integer, each d<sub>i</sub> is a digit between 0 and 9, and
the parentheses around the last r digits indicate that that sequence of 
digits repeats forever.

<p>
Notice that the repeating decimal representation of a rational number
is not unique.  For example, the rational number <b>13/6</b> is represented
by each of <b>2.1(6)</b>, <b>2.16(6)</b>, and <b>2.1(66)</b> 
(as well as infinitely many other such expressions).
We say that a repeating decimal representation is in <em>simplest form</em>
if the number of digits appearing after its decimal point is the minimum
possible.  Thus, for example, the simplest repeating decimal representation
of <b>13/6</b> is <b>2.1(6)</b>.
As another example, the simplest repeating decimal representation of 
<b>40/4</b> is <b>10.(0)</b>.

<p>
You are to develop a program that can translate a given rational number
into its simplest repeating decimal form.
The input will consist of a sequence of rational numbers, each given on
one line by a pair of nonnegative integers, the first representing a 
numerator and the second a denominator.
For each rational number given as input, your program should produce a
line of output containing its simplest repeating decimal representation.

<p>
In order to simplify the task of producing output, your results are to be
written in the form 
<p>
<center>p.d<sub>1</sub> d<sub>2</sub> 
<font face=symbol>¼</font> d<sub>n</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r, 
</center>

<p>
where r indicates the length of the repeating sequence of digits.
(See sample output below.)

<!--
<p>
You may assume that any rational number used in testing your program
is such that its simplest repeating decimal representation
has no more than fifty digits appearing after the decimal point.
