<h2>How to make jGrasp use spaces in place of tab characters</h2>

<h3>The Curse of the Tab Character</h3>
</p><p>
For those of us who view programs using a variety of applications
(i.e., various web browsers and/or text editors), tabs appearing
in source code files can be very annoying.  Why?
Because tabs are rendered differently in one application vs. another.  


</p><p>
Suppose, for example, that the following eight-line program segment
had been keyed in using jGrasp's text editor.
To the right of each line of code is a description of which characters
form the "whitespace" at the beginning of each line.
These descriptions are consistent with jGrasp's default setting, which
has each tab character being rendered as though it were three spaces.  
Despite what you may think, this example is not really as far-fetched
as it may first appear, especially if the code was cobbled together using
a sequence of editing operations in which code was moved around a lot.

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<pre>
   while (k != m)            (tab)
   {                         (3 spaces)
      cntr = cntr + 1;       (6 spaces)
      if (k < m)             (tab and 3 spaces)
         { m = m - k; }      (9 spaces)
      else                   (2 tabs)
         { k = k - m; }      (3 tabs)
   }                         (tab) </pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
Now suppose that the same code segment is displayed using an application
in which tab characters are rendered as though they were a sequence of
seven spaces.  The code segment would look like this:

</p><p>
<center>
<table border="1">
<tr><td>
<pre>
(1)       while (k != m)
(2)   {
(3)      cntr = cntr + 1;
(4)          if (k < m)
(5)         { m = m - k; }
(6)              else
(7)                     { k = k - m; }
(8)       }</pre>
</td></tr>
</table>
</center>

</p><p>
As you can see, the code is now ugly and virtually unreadable, as the
visual cues intended to be provided by code indentation have been destroyed.

<h3>How to Rid Ourselves, in jGrasp, of the Tabs Curse</h3>

<ol>
  <li>In the menu bar, click <b>Settings</b> and then choose <b>Font</b>
      from the menu.</li>
  <li>Click on the <b>CSD</b> tab.</li>
  <li>Turn on <b>Soft tabs</b> option.
      (Two boxes appear to its right.  Click on the right box and then
      on the left box.  This should cause a check mark to appear in the
      latter.)
      </p><p>
      With this option turned on, any tab characters entered on the
      keyboard will be treated as a sequence of space characters.
      How many spaces?  Use the <b>Tab Size</b> slider to choose.
      A good setting is 3.
      </p><p>
      It also means that, if the <b>Auto Indent</b> option is turned on,
      when jGrasp automatically indents a line of code, it will do so
      using spaces rather than tabs.
