## Data Structures - Organizing data to make retrieval and updating efficient

## File Structures - Where is it stored??? :O :O :O
  - Data Struct - assumption of storage in RAM. OS loads program into RAM along, and uses RAM for temporary storage
  - Write to Disk - 'Secondary' or Long Term storage


### BST Review
  -  time = O(n) where n is the number of levels in the tree
    - AVL Trees -> <= 1.44(log(n)). Guarantees some max levels of tree, to increase efficiency/speed
    - Red-Black
      - AVL tree would take long to access HDD, because every traversal of one node is one access to disk


 - File system generally uses a Hashed Tree
