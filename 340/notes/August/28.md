### Entity-Relationship Modeling
- main relationships in this model are:
  - Entity
  - Attributes
  - Relationship

# Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER)
  - Entity type is like a blueprint or a template for all potential entities 
  - A key is an attribute that identities any particular identity
    - No two people should have the same SSN
    - Attribute alone should be sufficient to be a key
ER Diagram
  - Entity types in Squares, attributes in Ovals
  - Then need to draw relationships between entity types.
  - Relationships go in diamonds between entity types
  EX: DEPENDANT DEPENDS ON EMPLOYEE (DEPENDS ON BEING IN A DIAMOND)
    - EMPLOYEE WORKS FOR DEPARTMENT (WORKS FOR BEING IN A DIAMOND)


Cardinality of Ratio Constraint
  - 1 : 1
  - N : N
  - 1 : N
  - M : N
- how many relationships can a given entity participate in?
  - 'WORKS FOR' is a 1:1 relationship
    - An employee can only work for one department
      - An instance of department can be related to any number of employees
      - Department 'CONTROLS' Project is ratio, A Project is related to *ONE* department, but a department can control any number of projects, so it is a 1:N Ratio
      - EMPLOYEE 'WORKS ON' PROJECT is M:N, since an employee can work on any number of projects, whilst a project can be worked on by many different employees
