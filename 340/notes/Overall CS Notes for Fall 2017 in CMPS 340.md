Adjacent into existing tombstone

- I wrote these notes while trying not to laugh at fucking buckets

 -  Perpetually completed

-  Best Fit

  - Place record in smallest tombstone that has sufficient space to fit record
  - keep tombstone ordered by size
    - kind of like a ordered link list
    - Numerical order by 
    - Where does the new record go
  - What's the obvious choice for record
    - shift every element
      - really bad way cause rewrite bytes
