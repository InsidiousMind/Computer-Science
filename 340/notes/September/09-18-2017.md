#### NOTES

- Aggregate Operations
```             STUID
AGGREGATE COUNT(*)
    WHERE CourseID=MATH2
```

GroupBy - specify which Attribute or Attributes to use as a basis for grouping the tuples
    - apply aggregate op not to the tuple but to each group in the tuple

```
AGGREGATE CourseId, Count(*)
FROM EnrolledIn
GROUP BY CourseID
```

- applies aggregate function to each group seperatly
    - count will be applied to MATH tuples to count them
    - applied Count tuples
    - result would jsut be a count column

            <td>3</td>
            <td>6</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

```
AGGREGATE Name, COUNT(*) AS NumCourses
FROM Join Student WITH EnrolledIn WHERE ID = StuID
GROUP BY StuID,Name
```

What if want to group by department and by Sex + Department #

```
AGGREGATE Dno, Sex, AvgSalary as AvgSalary
FROM JOIN Employee WITH Department WHERE Dno = Dnumber
GROUP BY Sex, Dno
```
