IBM Mainframes and their uses today

    - BS: CIS
    - Masters: Software Engineering
    - started IBM full-time in 2016, Pughkeepsie, NY
    - Mainframe ~ 50years old
        - first mainframe: 1964 April. IBM System 360
            - Capable of 13,300 decimal operations per second
            - Programmed via COBOL, RPG, Assembler, RPG, Fortran, PL/I
            - Started at $133,000 ($1,085,000 today)
        - IBM z14 : July 2017
            - Runs at 5.2GHz
                - Fastest microprocessor by clockspeed
                    - not a major part of how a mainframe works, but fun fact
                - can do up to 12 bil encrypted txs per day
                - 1,000 concurrent NoSQL databases
                - 2 million docker containers
            - Operating Systems
                - z/OS
                    - Mainframe-exclusive operating system
                    - emerged as *the* operating system for ibm mianframes
                    - 99.99% uptime for 97% of enterprise users (2015 survey)
                        - very stable; only way to knockout is something like state-wide power outage
                    - App-level compatibility maintained for all applications
                - z/TPF
                    - Transaction Processing Facility
                    - Real-Time operating system
                    - built for extreme volume and reliability
                        - Even more uptime/reliability
                - Linux on IBM Z
                    - Linux compiled for z/Architecture
                    - runs natively on mainframe hardware

What is z/OS?
    - Complex operating system with many components
    - JES (Job Entry Subsystem)
        - Mainframes built to do work
        - how to do work?
            - build up huge instructions/datasets
            - line it up in a file called a 'job'
            - JES handles this
    - NFS (Network File System)
        - need to know where data/files are at all times across network
    - USS (z/OS Unix System Services)
    - z/OSMF (z/OS Management Facility)
        - People still use terminals as the main way to interact with Mainframe
        - trying to move to newer form of UI
    - IOS (Input/Output Supervisor)
        - Anytime need to pull data off an accessory device, IOS handles that
    - Contents Supervisor
        - like a 'God in the Cloud' that sits above everything that happens in zBOX
        - can see everything thats going on,
    - RACF (Resource Access Control Facility - priced product)
        - Security Component of Z
        - priced product; everything else in above list is included in z/OS
            - RACF is not, need to pay for it and developed by IBM

Top 6 industries using mainframe technology
    - Banking
        - Account Transactions, ATM Operations
    - Insurance
        - Customer data, claims processing
    - Healthcare
        - Patient records, prescriptions. Things like this need to be processed quickly
    - Government
        - "They Do Really Cool Stuff"
    - Aviation
        - flight bookings/schedule -- part of what built the tech in the first place
    - Retail
        - Purchases, refunds, other transactions, etc etc

What can Mainframes Do Today
    - Pervasive Encryption
        - enabled by z14 hardware
        - all mainframe data encrypted in-flight and at-rest
    - Multi-Factor Authentication
        - same idea applies with multi factor authentication on mainframe
        - Token Identification and more
        - integrated into 40-year-old products!
    - Parallel Sysplex
        - link multiple mainframes together as one "system" image
        - Data sharing + parallel computing = high availability
        - data redundancy - many data centers around US
        - Enabled via XCF - Cross System Coupling Facility
        - Introduced 1994
        - Run the world's biggest companies
            - 92 of largest 100 banks
            - top 10 largest insurance companies
            - 23 of the top 25 airlines
            - 23 of the top 25 retailers
    - What challenges does the mainframe face?
        - Dwindling Skill Base
        - Highly Skilled veterans at or near retirement age
            - becoming mainframe expert takes decades
        - lack of fresh faces
            - mainframes struggle to compete with 'cooler' platforms
            - Formal mainframe education is limited
            - Hiring increasing across the industry, ut more is needed
        - increasing complexity
            - nothing gets easier to use and maintain
