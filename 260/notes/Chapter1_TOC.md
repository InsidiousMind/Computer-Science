- Nothing - {} Collection of nothin {{}} collection of a collection of two things {{}, {}}
- Strings are just finite sequences of symbols, chosen from a fixed alphabet
- Empty word, unique string w/o symbols = _e_
  - length of word _w_
  - number of symbols _|w|_
  - if _w_ is a word, _w^R_ denotes the reverse
    - EX: if w = 110, w^R = 011
      - if w = w^R, w is a palindrome
- set of words is a language

#### Sets
- if S is a set, Sbar is a complement of the set
- if E is even numbers Ebar is set of all numbers which are not even
- pigeonhole principle
- symmetric, transitive, equivalent relations
- bijections, inverse

#### Set Complements
- set complements only taken of a larger set
- if E is even nums, Ebar is set of all nums which are not even.
